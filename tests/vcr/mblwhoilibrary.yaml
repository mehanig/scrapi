        whales (Cetacea, odontoceti) use biosonar to navigate their environment and
        to find and catch prey. All studied toothed whale species have evolved highly
        directional, high-amplitude ultrasonic clicks suited for long-range echolocation
        of prey in open water. Little is known about the biosonar signals of toothed
        whale species inhabiting freshwater habitats such as endangered river dolphins.
        To address the evolutionary pressures shaping the echolocation signal parameters
        of non-marine toothed whales, we investigated the biosonar source parameters
        of Ganges river dolphins (Platanista gangetica gangetica) and Irrawaddy dolphins
        (Orcaella brevirostris) within the river systems of the Sundarban mangrove
        forest. Both Ganges and Irrawaddy dolphins produced echolocation clicks with
        a high repetition rate and low source level compared to marine species. Irrawaddy
        dolphins, inhabiting coastal and riverine habitats, produced a mean source
        level of 195 dB (max 203 dB) re 1 \xB5Papp whereas Ganges river dolphins,
        living exclusively upriver, produced a mean source level of 184 dB (max 191)
        re 1 \xB5Papp. These source levels are 1\u20132 orders of magnitude lower
        than those of similar sized marine delphinids and may reflect an adaptation
        to a shallow, acoustically complex freshwater habitat with high reverberation
        and acoustic clutter. The centroid frequency of Ganges river dolphin clicks
        are an octave lower than predicted from scaling, but with an estimated beamwidth
        comparable to that of porpoises. The unique bony maxillary crests found in
        the Platanista forehead may help achieve a higher directionality than expected
        using clicks nearly an octave lower than similar sized odontocetes.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        of Bolivina argentea and Bulimina marginata, two widely distributed temperate
        benthic foraminiferal species, were cultured at constant temperature and controlled
        pCO2 (ambient, 1000 ppmv, and 2000 ppmv) for six weeks to assess the effect
        of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations on survival and fitness using Adenosine
        Triphosphate (ATP) analyses and on shell microfabric using high-resolution
        SEM and image analysis. To characterize the carbonate chemistry of the incubation
        seawater, total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon were measured approximately
        every two weeks. Survival and fitness were not directly affected by elevated
        pCO2 and the concomitant decrease in seawater pH and calcite saturation states
        (\u03A9c), even when seawater was undersaturated with respect to calcite.
        These results differ from some previous observations that ocean acidification
        can cause a variety of effects on benthic foraminifera, including test dissolution,
        decreased growth, and mottling (loss of symbiont color in symbiont-bearing
        species), suggesting that the benthic foraminiferal response to ocean acidification
        may be species specific. If so, this implies that ocean acidification may
        lead to ecological winners and losers even within the same taxonomic group.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This
