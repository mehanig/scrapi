        Investigations on the Rio Napo, Eastern Ecuador</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Evans,
        Clifford</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Meggers, Betty</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The
        eastern slopes of the Andes attracted our attention in 1950, when it became\nprobable
        that the Marajoara Phase on the island of Marajo at the mouth of the Amazon\nwas
        derived from northwestern South America. Our first opportunity to investigate
        the\npossibilities for archeological fieldwork came when we were in Guayaquil,
        Ecuador, in\n1954 and met Coronel Jorge V. Gortoire, who had served for a
        period as commandant\nof the Ecuadorian Army Post at Tiputini. Conversation
        with him reawakened our latent\ninterest in the area, and we began to make
        specific plans. In October 1956, having been\nawarded Grant No. 2012 from
        the Penrose Fund by the American Philosophical Society\nand granted official
        detail by the Smithsonian Institution, we returned to Ecuador to\nundertake
        the fieldwork.\n    Through the courtesy of Coronel Rafael Andrade Ochoa,
        at that time Commander-\ngeneral of the Fuerza Aerea Ecuatoriana, we received
        authorization to fly from Quito\nto Tiputini in an Ecuadorian Air Force DC-3
        transport plane. However, almost daily\nrains maintained the airstrip in unsuitable
        condition for landing and after several weeks\nof waiting in Quito for the
        weather to break, we gave up and arranged to fly by commercial\nairline in
        a Junkers Tri-Motor to Shell-Mera and then in a single engine Norseman to\nTena.
        A day on horseback brought us to Latas, where we secured a dugout canoe manned\nby
        Quechua-speaking Indians to take us downriver. Although the trip was longer
        and\nmore difficult than it would have been by air, it gave us invaluable
        first-hand experience\nwith conditions along the Rio Napo (pis. 1-5). We were
        able to follow our hourly progress\non U.S. Air Force Preliminary Base Map
        950A (Scale 1:500,000), which perfectly repro-\nduced every bend and island.
        By the afternoon of the fifth day, when we arrived at Tiputini,\nwe were well
        prepared to appreciate the comments of Orellana's men, who preceded us\nby
        415 years.\n    When we stepped on shore at Tiputini, the military post that
        was to be our base of\noperations, we were delighted to discover not only
        that there was an archeological site\non the spot, but that the pottery included
        incised and excised techniques of decoration\ndiagnostic of the Marajoara
        Phase, although only painted vessels had been previously\nreported from the
        Rio Napo. With the cooperation of army personnel and local residents,\nwe
        were able to investigate a number of sites particularly along the portion
        of the river\nbetween Tiputini and the mouth of the Rio Yasuni, which marks
        the boundary between\nEcuador and Peru. We also checked the lower Rio Tiputini.
        During our stay, the river\nwas unusually low, and extensive sand bars reduced
        the channel in places to a slender\nmeandering stream (pi. 4b). Giant trees
        temporarily resting on beaches (pi. 3b) attested\nto the force of the current
        at other times of the year, lending credence to descriptions by\nOrellana's
        companions (see pp. 106-107), who had the misfortune to encounter higher\nwater
        than we did.\n    At the conclusion of the survey, we had accumulated several
        tons of specimens and\nwere sufficiently familiar with the river to look forward
        to returning to Quito by air. As\nwas the case in October, intermittent rain
        kept the airstrip soft, but we were prepared to\nwait as long as necessary
        this time, since going by river would have taken at least two\nweeks. An Ecuadorian
        Air Force DC-3 finally came on December 15, and two hours after\ntakeoff we
        were in Quito\u2014by every standard of comparison, another world.\n    We
        left behind us in the Province of Napo-Pastaza many friends never to be seen\nagain,
        and memories still fresh as we write this ten years later. Sr. Jose Bernardo
        Crespo\nPando made us his guests while we worked at Nueva Armenia, and allowed
        us to use his\nhome as a base from which to visit nearby sites. Philosopher,
        businessman, and astute\nobserver of the world from afar, he was an invaluable
        promoter of our cause as^ well as\nan entertaining host. Several pleasant
        days were also spent at the home of Sr. Jose Rafael\nUrvina on the Rio Tiputini,
        where we received all possible cooperation and courtesy.\nOther land owners
        who granted us permission to work on their property and to whom\nwe offer
        our thanks are Sr. Juan Francisco Buitron (Hacienda San Juan, Cotacocha),\nSr.
        Osvaldo Bijarini Aridi (Florencia), and Sr. Alfonso Antonio Cox Vega (Bello
        Hori-\nzonte). Sr. Pedro Jamn, at that time Jefe Politico of the Junta del
        Canton Aguarico,\nkindly allowed us to dig a few holes in the main street
        of Nuevo Rocafuerte.\n    Since we were unable to arrange for a trip to the
        Rio Aguarico, we are particularly\nindebted to Rene Alberto Hinoyosa Carrera,
        then a second lieutenant stationed at Tipu-\ntini, who collected sherds for
        us from Cabo Minacho on the Rio Giiepi and Panacocha\non the Rio Cuyabeno
        (fig. 3). Other young officers at Tiputini, who provided us not\nonly with
        various kinds of assistance but also with pleasant companionship, include
        Solo-\nman Hernandez V., Augustin Carvalho V., Raul Costales, and Fausto Bustamonte.
        We\nare indebted to the commandant at that time, then Major J. Gonzalo Ramos
        Sevilla,\nfor permitting us to use Tiputini as our base, and providing us
        with quarters and other\nkinds of help.\n    During our negotiations to enter
        the Oriente by air, we were aided in numerous ways\nby Jorge V. Gortaire V.,
        then a colonel and director of the Colegio Militar \"Eloy Alfaro\"\nin Quito.
        Other kinds of help and guidance were provided by Enrique Martinez Q.,\nmanager
        of the Compania General de Comercio y Mandato in Quito, and his assistant\nFrancisco
        Punina Y. To these and other military and governmental officials whose names\nescape
        us after a decade, we wish to express our appreciation for the many favors,
        large\nand small, that we have not forgotten, and which helped to make our
        visit memorable\nas well as scientifically fruitful.\n    Finally, we wish
        to record our indebtedness to the late Emilio Estrada, who while\nteasing
        us for persisting in our \"whim\" to go to the Rio Napo, exercised his considerable\ninfluence
        to help us secure the necessary permissions from military authorities. Although\nhis
        interventions were often unobtrusive, it is probable that they were instrumental
        in\nmaking it possible for us to carry out the work described in the present
        report.\n    Other obligations have been incurred during efforts to work out
        the affiliations of\nRio Napo archeological complexes. Our ability to trace
        the downriver movement of the\nPolychrome Horizon Style (fig. 68) stems from
        permission granted by the Ethnographical\nMuseum in Goteborg, Sweden, to take
        detailed notes and photographs during the summer\nof 1960 of sherd samples
        collected in the 1920's by Curt Nimuendajii. This museum work\nwas supported
        financially by Grant No. 2664 from the Penrose Fund of the American\nPhilosophical
        Society. Peter Paul Hilbert, who is responsible for what little stratigraphic\ninformation
        is available from the middle and upper Amazon, has again generously made\navailable
        unpublished data. Donald Lathrap, whose chronological sequence in eastern\nPeru
        is one of the rare reliable reference points, has kindly allowed us to consult
        his un-\npublished doctoral dissertation at Harvard University, which supplements
        data secured\nby examination of the collections from his 1956 fieldwork. We
        wish also to record our\nappreciation to the American Museum of Natural History,
        the Museum of the American\nIndian (Heye Foundation), the Brooklyn Museum,
        the Museum of Primitive Art, the\n    Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology
        (Harvard University), the Musee de\nl'Homme (Paris), the Museu Paraense Emilio
        Goeldi (Belem), the Museu Paulista (Sao\nPaulo), the Instituto Geografico
        e Historico do Amazonas (Manaus), the Museo Victor\nEmilio Estrada (Guayaquil),
        the Museo Arqueologico del Banco Central del Ecuador\n(Quito), and the Casa
        de la Cultura Ecuatoriana (Quito), all of which have granted us\npermission
        to examine and photograph specimens or have provided us with photographs\nfor
        publication. Several Napo Phase anthropomorphic urns have passed into the
        hands of\nprivate collectors, who have allowed us to include them in our illustrations.
        To Thomas P.\nFlannery, Alan C. Lapiner, Jay C. Leff and Howard S. Strouth,
        we take this opportunity\nto offer public thanks.\n    Carbon-14 dates have
        been furnished by the Smithsonian Institution and the Univer-\nsity of Pennsylvania.
        We are indebted to the Creole Foundation for a grant to assist in\nobtaining
        the first series of dates from the latter laboratory.\n    In conclusion,
        it is a pleasure to record once again our indebtedness to members of the\nSmithsonian
        Office of Anthropology Processing Lab staff, especially Willie Mae Pelham\nand
        Robert C. Jenkins, for their careful preparation of the sherd collections
        for study.\nGeorge Robert Lewis, scientific illustrator in the Smithsonian
        Office of Anthropology, has\nproduced his customarily excellent drawings from
        badly eroded pottery, poor illustrations\nin published sources or photographs,
        as well as the maps and diagrams. We apologize for\ndelaying so many years
        to provide them with captions. The plates owe their clarity to the\nhigh quality
        enlargements furnished by the staff of the Smithsonian Institution Museum\nof
        Natural History Photo Lab. The manuscript was efficiently typed by Anne M.
        Lewis,\nSmithsonian Office of Anthropology.\n    For scholars interested in
        consulting the illustrated material, some clarification of the\nsymbols and
        legends may be useful. All specimens not otherwise credited are in the United\nStates
        National Museum, where a large type collection of sherds has been deposited.\nSpecimens
        in other collections are so identified, and addition of the word \"courtesy\"\nindicates
        that the photographs were supplied by the individual or institution named.\nA
        key has been employed in figures showing rim profiles, permitting rapid recognition
        of\nassociation between form and presence or absence of red slip or decoration,
        explained in\neach caption. The relative frequency of rims, shown in black,
        white, or hachure, approxi-\nmates the relative popularity of the form with
        each type of surface treatment.\nCE\nBJM\nSmithsonian Institution\nWashington,

        program lasting three years entitled \"Interrelationships of New World Cultures\"
        and organized by the Institute of Andean Research with financement from the
        National Science Foundation (Ekholm and Evans, 1962). Evidence of interconnection
        during the Formative period and at other points in time was sought in particular
        regions of the Intermediate area between Mesoamerica and South America. The
        Panam\xC8\xEDnian region surveyed is the Pacific coast from the Costa Rican
        border to the Colombian border. It was covered in two consecutive seasons.
        The first, in February through May of 1961, included the western coast and
        principal offshore islands from Punta Burica to Punta Mariato in the southwestern
        corner of the Azuero Peninsula. The second, in 1962, extended the work to
        cover coastal Darien. This is a report of the work done in the first season.
        The participants of the project were Dr. Charles R. McGimsey III of the University
        of Arkansas, as principal investigator, and two assistants, besides me, who
        were also graduate students at the time: Mr. William Bishop, geologist, and
        Mr. Freeman Mobley, ethnologist, both from the University of Arkansas. In
        four months we visited over 60 sites and tested 12 of these. To each of the
        sites that we recorded we assigned a letter-number combination. The letters
        designated the district, and the numbers, the sites in the order found. The
        site of El Cangrejal was thus given the code number SL-1, with SL standing
        for the district of San Lorenzo in the province of Chiriqu\xED, and number
        1 standing for the first site found in this district. Island sites could not
        be assigned to districts, so they were simply given a number preceded by the
        letters IS which stand for \"isla.\" Thus, Isla Villalba became IS-7, Isla
        Palenque became IS-3, and Islas Las Secas became IS-11. Reported in this study
        are the four most important sites where the most concentrated work was done.
        These are the sites mentioned above, all of them located in the Chiriqu\xED
        Gulf. Three are on islands, the fourth on the mainland. Distances between
        them vary. The closest to each other are Isla Villalba (IS-7) and El Cangrejal
        (SL-1), separated by 10 kilometers of water channels. The farthest away is
        Las Secas (IS-11); it is 37 kilometers from Isla Palenque (IS-3), 53 kilometers
        from Isla Villalba (IS-7), and 55 kilometers from El Cangrejal (SL-1). The
        three island sites are located on ridges in back of the beaches, often the
        highest spot available. The mainland site is on a high bank near the edge
        of an estuary. All four sites consist of middens formed by the deposition
        of abundant cultural materials: discarded pottery, stone tools, and the remains
        of marine and land fauna. These were choice locations and, to judge from the
        refuse, the occupation of them was continuous. Listed in summary form, the
        main aims of this report are as follows: (1) To establish a preliminary chronology
        for the Gulf of Chiriqu\xED, based on local sequences of pottery; (2) to trace,
        in time and space, the cultural contacts of the inhabitants of these sites
        with each other and with peoples on the mainland; (3) to reconstruct as much
        as possible the manner of living and the subsistence patterns of the occupants
        of these sites; (4) to summarize ethnohistorical accounts of the area in an
        effort to tie these in with the terminal part of the archeological sequence;
        (5) to place the Chiriqu\xC8\xA1 phases in proper chronological relationship
        to other Panamanian sequences; and (6) to relate the chronology thus established
        to those of other lower Central American areas. Two approaches were used in
        our pottery classification. The first was a subdivision of the decorated sherds
        into types, differentiated from each other primarily by decorative treatment
        and secondarily by paste attributes. Their percentage frequencies were plotted
        by levels. Since the plain pottery does not always appear to show any distinctive
        differences in temper or paste, it was not divided into the full, conventional
        pottery type description, but instead was sorted into groups named A-J. Only
        one plain ware was distinctive enough to be described fully and was labeled
        Tarrago Bisquit Ware. Perhaps a larger sample from more sites in Chiriqu\xED,
        or from sites with deeper stratified refuse, will eventually permit the detailed
        refinement of the plain wares, but for this study they receive secondary treatment
        even though the percentages were always calculated and actually show some
        interesting trends in the site seriation charts. There are also some small
        samples of pottery types that fit into the \"Classical\" Chiriqu\xED wares
        known for so many decades from the large museum collections; they are listed
        under their well-known published names. The pottery type description follows
        the style established in earlier Smithsonian publications on the archeology
        of South America, with each type subdivided into the major categories of paste,
        surface, form, decoration, and chronological position. To these I have added
        one other category: geographical distribution and comparative materials. For
        the color identifications of paste or surfaces, words rather than the Munsell
        Color Chart have been used, for no more precise a code is needed to describe
        pottery with only simple paints, no polychrome, and variable firing. Hardness
        is stated in the Mohs scale. It is perhaps interesting to record how the rim
        profiles were drawn. To facilitate and increase the accuracy of the rim profile
        drawings, a section from each rim was cut with a blunt-edged carbide geological
        power saw at right angles to the lip. Unless the rim was badly mutilated,
        I always cut a section on the right side of the rim exterior so that, when
        drawn, all rim profiles faced in the same direction. By cutting the rim it
        was easy to trace the correct profile because it lay flat on the paper. A
        second method of analysis used in this report, first separately, and then
        in conjunction with the type approach, is a modal analysis of all appendages
        (supports and handles) found in each level of the pits. I have chosen to use
        \"mode\" to mean \"a small group of inseparable attributes\" because this
        is useful in making geographical comparisons. If, for example, a tripod foot
        shares a cluster of salient attributes with a tripod foot in another area,
        one can be reasonably certain that some kind of historical relationship, rather
        than mere chance, accounts for the similarities. In this study, modes have
        been kept separate from types by using different, though not mutually exclusive,
        criteria for classification. The main criterion used in the type approach
        is surface decoration; in the modal approach, the main criterion for distinguishing
        modes is shape. These criteria could just as well be reversed in another area.
        The result is that modes and types often crosscut, so that the same mode may
        appear in more than one type. This may have interesting cultural and chronological
        implications. The potters, conforming to standardized stylistic patterns (types),
        were able to isolate features (modes) in this pattern and reproduce them in
        another context. Chronologically, a mode that crosscuts two types may sometimes
        indicate contemporaneity as, for example, with Tripod Foot Mode e, which appears
        in two different but contemporaneous types. A separate modal approach, based
        on shape elements rather than on painted motifs, is particularly suited to
        an analysis of the Gulf of Chiriqu\xED collections because this area belongs
        to a primarily plastic tradition. Paints and slips were used, to be sure,
        but vessels of the Gulf were not elaborately painted as they were in the Cocl\xC8\xA8-Azuero
        region. Rather, it is the shape of handles, supports, and rims, and the manner
        in which these were decorated with plastic motifs, such as applique strips,
        incisions, and punctations, that make Chiriqu\xED pottery so enormously varied.
        Using a modal analysis had advantages of a very practical nature. Handles,
        feet, and supports are so distinctive that they can be recognized easily in
        any context. Since the surface collections (Ranere, Appendix 2) were made
        without any regard to randomness, they contain a disproportionate number of
        such fragments. A modal approach serves to relate these to the excavated collections.
        The distribution of certain modes beyond the Chiriqu\xED Gulf has also offered
        important insights into the influences that came there from Costa Rica and
        from the central provinces of Panam\xE1. In short, modes were used in this
        study as timemakers and as indices of geographical distribution. From them
        we could draw inferences concerning wider cultural contacts. I have used several
        criteria to interdigitate the site sequences and to mark off units of time
        into phases: (1) the appearance of new types in the stratigraphic columns;
        (2) marked contrasts in the percentage frequencies of pottery types; (3) the
        presence or absence of particular modes; (4) the association of types; and
        (5) the presence of trade wares from known areas. The use of these criteria
        was facilitated by the deep stratified sequence of Pit No. 3 at Site IS-3.
        A very distinctive type of pottery was strongly represented in the bottom
        levels, different types were associated with the intermediate levels, and
        the most recent levels were marked by the appearance of several new types.
        In addition, modes were absent from some levels and present in others, and
        trade pottery from several phases of the Cocle-Azuero area came in at different
        levels and served to confirm my phase divisions. The other three sites, none
        of which had the complete sequence represented, were therefore interdigitated
        with reference to IS-3. The assumption made was that all four sites were close
        enough geographically to show the same general chronological trends. Contrasts
        in the percentage frequencies of pottery types proved useful in coordinating
        pit levels within a site and in differentiating between units of levels in
        which certain types were heavily represented from units in which they were
        not. The pottery types are described by phase for easy reference, moving from
        the oldest to the most recent in the sequence. The modes are described separately.
        Stone tools and shell ornaments found at these sites were not used in establishing
        a tentative chronology because they did not show enough changes through time.
        Along with bones and mollusks, however, they are essential to our cultural
        reconstructions. A description of surface collections from 26 sites in the
        adjacent districts of San Felix and Remedios has been appended (Ranere, Appendix
        2) to the body of the report, which describes our excavations, to enlarge
        the scope of this analysis. In this appendix Mr. Ranere has contributed ethnohistorical
        data and new insights into the archeological material, making his section
        an important part of this work. I would like to thank first Dr. Charles R.
        McGimsey III, principal investigator of the project, for inviting me to collaborate
        in the field work and for asking me to report and interpret the results. The
        success of the expedition was also due to Mr. William Bishop and Mr. Freeman
        Mobley, who were indefatigable in their search for sites and acute in their
        observations of the Panamanian countryside. The authorities of Panam\xE1,
        as well as Dr. Alejandro M\xE9ndez, Director of the Museo Nacional, and Dra.
        Reina Torres de Araiiz, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Panam\xC8\xED,
        greatly supported the work by their kind cooperation. The entire survey was
        facilitated by cartographic aids provided by Ing. Amado Araiiz of the Subcomite
        del Darien and of the Pan American Highway Program. Ample laboratory space
        to analyze the collections was generously provided by Professor John Otis
        Brew, Director of the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology at Harvard
        University. A grant from the National Science Foundation and a Thaw Fellowship
        in the Peabody Museum permitted survival during the summer and fall of 1963,
        when the first, unrevised version of this monograph was being prepared as
        a doctoral dissertation (Linares, 1964). Drs. George Cowgill, James Gifford,
        and John Ladd were knowledgeable in their advice on how to handle particular
        problems in the analysis. Mr. Anthony J. Renere worked with me on the Chiriqu\xED
        collections and expanded this study in his Appendix No. 2. Mrs. Alexandra
        W. de Garc\xEDa-Bryce advised me on the latest sources for Latin American
        Archeology. Miss Margaret Currier of the Peabody Museum Library was helpful
        in the initial research. Mr. Arsen Charles took the photographs on plate 14.
        From Professor Gordon R. Willey of Harvard University, I have received endless
        encouragement through the years and most of my knowledge of New World Archeology.
        My intellectual debt to him is enormous. Expert advice was provided in 1964
        by several investigators of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University.
        Dr. W. J. Clench, Curator of Mollusks, guided my identifications of the shellfish
        material; Dr. E. E. Williams, Curator of Reptiles and Amphibians, sorted out
        at a glance any reptiles represented on a mass of tiny fragments. All mammal
        bones were identified by Mr. Charles Mack. Mr. William Bishop, geologist for
        the expedition, made the rock identifications while in the field, and the
        material identifications in the descriptions of stone artifacts are all his;
        his report on the geology of the coast, from which Mr. Ranere and I have quoted
        extensively, has been of additional value. Mrs. Charles R. McGimsey did the
        field cataloging of all materials collected and took the photographs of stone
        artifacts for plates 19 and 20. Dr. Clifford Evans and Dr. Betty J. Meggers
        of the Smithsonian Institution have spent countless hours over the last years
        teaching me to classify pottery, making suggestions about plans of research,
        and helping me in every phase of preparing this manuscript for publication.
        I cannot thank them enough for their generous help. Dr. Alexander Wetmore,
        Research Associate of the Smithsonian Institution, provided various maps from
        his vast collections that were the basis for the final maps produced in this
        report. To Mrs. Marcia P. Bakry, Scientific Illustrator of the Office of Anthropology,
        Museum of Natural History, I wish to express my appreciation for preparing
        the final copies of the maps and seriation charts. I have profited greatly
        from conversations with Dr. Claude F. Baudez of the Mus\xE9e de l'Homme, regarding
        his archeological investigations in nearby Costa Rica. Recently, Dr. Roberto
        de la Guardia of the Museo Chiricano in David, Panam\xE1, brought me up to
        date on finds in Chiriqu\xED. In typical Latin American style, my work became
        a true family enterprise. Sr. Frank Linares Danz, my father, loaned a jeep
        to the expedition, and Sr. Guillermo Tribaldos, Jr., my grandfather, made
        his boat available to us. Sra. Olga Tribaldos de Linares, my mother, did the
        drawings of the artifacts, prepared an original version of the pottery type
        frequency charts, and typed this report twice, first as a dissertation, then
        as a manuscript for publication. Their interest in my work is immensely gratifying.
        I also thank my husband, J. David Sapir, for his patience and continuous encouragement.

        collection of 260 dream texts from Zinacantan, Chiapas,\nMexico, was recorded
        in Tzotzil, primarily during 1963, and subsequently\ntranslated by the author
        into English. Dreams are ascribed considerable impor-\ntance by the Zinacantecs,
        who see them not merely as portents of future events,\nbut as actual, present
        encounters of the individual's soul, both in its contest\nwith the souls of
        hostile humans and in communicataion with the deities.\nDreams inform an individual
        of his capacity as a musician, a bonesetter, a mid-\nwife, or a shaman.\n
        \ Over one hundred dream motifs are given standard interpretations by the\nZinacantecs,
        who modify them to fit personal situations.\n  Included here are the dreams
        of eleven Zinacantecs, two of whom were shamans.\nTheir richness of dialogue
        and imagery represent a hitherto much neglected aspect\nof Middle American

        of Demographic Profiles from Ossuary Skeletal Samples: A Case Study from the
        Tidewater Potomac</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Ubelaker, Douglas H.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The
        excavation and\nanalysis of two Late Woodland ossuaries from the Juhle site
        (18CH89) in southern\nMaryland are described in detail. The report includes
        a discussion of archeological\nfeatures of the ossuaries, but emphasizes the
        reconstruction of population profiles\nderived from the analysis of the recovered
        skeletal samples. Ethnohistorical and arche-\nological sources are consulted
        to suggest that ossuaries contain nearly all individuals\nwho died in the
        contributing populations during culturally prescribed numbers of years\nand,
        consequently, offer somewhat unique opportunities for demographic analysis.\n
        \    Several methods are employed to estimate the chronological age at death
        of indi-\nviduals in both ossuaries. Subadult ages are derived from the formation
        and eruption\nof the teeth and from the maximum length of the femora. Adult
        ages are calculated\nfrom examinations of the symphyseal faces of the pubes
        and the degree of microscopic\ncortical remodeling in the femora. The latter
        method involved the preparation of 151\nground thin sections taken from the
        anterior cortices of the right femora, and it repre-\nsents the first application
        of Kerley's relatively new method (1965) to a large arche-\nological population.
        The resulting death curves are compared and the methods\nevaluated. Data from
        the most reliable of these age-determinative methods are used to\ncalculate
        curves of mortality and survivorship, life tables, and crude mortality rates
        for\nthe populations represented.\n     Population estimates are attempted
        by utilizing the crude mortality rates (calcu-\nlated from the life tables),
        the length of time represented by each ossuary (calculated\nfrom archeological
        data), and the total numbers of individuals in the ossuaries. The\nresulting
        population size estimates are considered against both archeological and\nethnohistorical
        data to suggest the nature of the sociopolitical unit serviced by the\nossuaries.
        Finally, both local and regional population-size estimates are compared with\nthose
        estimated by others using different types of data.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:53:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:58:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:53:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:58:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1974-08-08</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        of Sandia Cave</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Haynes, C. Vance, Jr.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Agogino,
        George A.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Excavations in Sandia Cave, New Mexico,
        in the late 1930s provided the first recognized stratigraphic evidence for
        a pre-Folsom culture in North America. This, the Sandia complex, is represented
        by diagnostic projectile points found in a loose deposit underlying a limonite
        ocher deposit which, in turn, underlies a cave breccia containing Folsom artifacts
        and reportedly sealed by an overlying dripstone. Our investigations in the
        1960s revealed that the Sandia deposit (unit X) is in fact, a rodent deposit
        created by bioturbation of the limonite ocher (unit C) and contains material
        derived from most of the other deposits. A second dripstone (unit D) is recognized
        as being much older (preoccupation) than the post-Folsom dripstone, instead
        of being a contemporary facies as originally reported. Its absence from the
        deposits near the mouth of the cave is believed to be due to removal during
        the mining of the yellow ocher by Paleo-Indians. Paleoclimatic interpretations
        of the stratigraphic units include (1) a warm moist period for the derivation
        of the ocher by leaching from a pedalferic paleosol formed during a previous
        cool moist period, (2) desiccation of the ocher during a dry climate, (3)
        formation of the lower dripstone during a cool moist period, (4) gypsum precipitation
        (unit E) due to either a dry period or opening of the cave or both, and (5)
        accumulation of dust and debris (units F and H) under dry conditions alternating
        with dripstones (units G and I) and breccia cementation under wet conditions.
        From 14,000 B.P. on, the cave interior was accessible to man and animals.
        Accumulation of dust and debris (unit F) occurred during a dry period during
        which a portion of the lower dripstone was removed, presumably by Paleo-Indians
        in order to extract ocher. During the subsequent moist period the artifact-bearing
        debris became cemented by cave drip where not protected by the lower dripstone.
        Under recent climatic conditions another loose debris layer (unit J) has accumulated
        during the middle and late Holocene and has always been connected to the lower
        loose-debris deposit (unit X). We conclude that Sandia points are definitely
        less than 14,000 years old and suggest they may be specialized Clovis or Folsom
        artifacts used for mining ocher. However, we cannot preclude a pre-Clovis
        age or even post-Folsom. Undisturbed cave strata provide valuable paleoenvironmental
        data, but redeposition and bioturbation is the rule rather than the exception
        for most, if not all, cave deposits that were once unconsolidated debris.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:41:12Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:58:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:41:12Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:58:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1986-04-21</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        of the Tobelo People: A Study in Folk Classification</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Taylor,
        Paul Michael</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The This ethnographic study of
        folk biology among the Tobelo (a West Papuan-speaking ethnic group of Halmahera
        Island, Maluku, Indonesia) outlines local cultural presumptions about classifying
        flora and fauna, describes the system of folk biological nomenclature in terms
        consistent with the morphology and syntax of the Tobelo language, and analyzes
        the local system of folk classification within a posited semantic domain of
        \"biotic forms.\" In the local linguistic context, dialectal differences,
        multilingualism, an apparently strict in-law name taboo, and particular speech
        registers for which Tobelo consider their own language inappropriate are shown
        to affect word formation, the adoption of foreign plant and animal names,
        and other aspects of ethnobiological classification. Culturally, the belief
        that names for plants and animals were set down by ancestors vastly more familiar
        with local biota than are their descendants, the notion that there is a \"proper\"
        name for virtually all easily visible plants and animals, and that much knowledge
        is and should remain esoteric, justify several alternative ways in which the
        Tobelo may reconcile individual or dialectal variation to determine \"proper\"
        details of classification consistent with these presumptions. Nomenclature
        is considered in detail. The importance of recognizing the lexemic status
        of homonymous and polysemous terms is illustrated; and means of recognizing
        lexemes having the same form as non-lexemic expressions are detailed. A morphosyntactic
        classification of lexemic types is here applied to the formation of terms
        in this domain. Unlabeled classes within this semantic domain (including the
        highest-level class BIOTIC FORM) are posited, and new methods are presented
        for determining and evaluating such \"covert categories.\" A critique of other
        procedures based on perceived similarities among plants and animals shows
        that the only local cultural significance of those classes may be their sudden
        appearance as a result of tests designed to find them, that similarities observed
        may not be those used in hierarchically relating folk taxa, and that such
        classes do not in any case belong in a linguistic description. From a systematic
        review of Tobelo lexemes it is possible to avoid these difficulties. The analysis
        of Tobelo folk biological classification (the system of semantic relations
        among usually lexically labeled classes) provides various types of evidence
        for the distinctiveness of a \"basic\" level, and details methods for distinguishing
        basic terms. Taxonomic relations order the set of hierarchically related folk
        classes into eleven levels: the widest or \"basic\" level, along with six
        above and four below. Non-\"regular\" elements of this folk taxonomy include
        nonsymmetric and disjunctive contrast, \"residue\" of higher-level classes,
        ambiguous subclass-superclass relations, and dual structural positions of
        a single class in the overall hierarchic structure. Also analyzed are other
        types of semantic relations among folk classes, including a \"mother\"-\"child\"
        relation among FAUNAL FORMS, crosscutting and intersecting subclasses of the
        basic class, and classification by growth stage and size. The Tobelo are able
        to use these methods of classifying local fauna and flora to justify the observed
        differences among themselves (or among Tobelo dialects) in how they classify
        the same plants and animals. They even sometimes use this classificatory system
        to productively predict the existence of plants and animals that have not
        yet been observed, much as our chemists once used the Periodic Table of the
        Elements to predict the existence of elements that had not been observed.
        Detailed folk classificatory, nomenclatural, and systematic botanical and
        zoological information for all recorded BIOTIC FORMS is given in the appendixes,
        which are based upon extensive collections of Halmaheran terrestrial and marine
        animals and plants, along with their associated ethnographic information.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:41:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:58:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:41:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:58:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990-06-01</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        T. Dale</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Excavations by Judge William J. Graham
        and by T. Dale Stewart of the U.S. National Museum/Natural History from 1935
        to 1940 at Potomac Neck in Stafford County, Virginia (site 44St2), produced
        evidence of a Late Woodland palisaded village (seven concentric palisade lines),
        enclosing an area of about 1.4 acres (0.56 ha). In the village were circular
        and elongate houses, plus storage pits, and three mass graves (ossuaries).
        The village proper dates from pre-Contact times. Two burial pits (one outside
        the palisade, and one that intruded into the outer palisade line) contained
        European trade items, indicating use of the site during post-Contact times,
        probably limited to a short time following the first European visit to the
        area by Captain John Smith in 1608. Extensive collections of cultural materials
        and data exemplify what Karl Schmitt in 1952 named the Potomac Creek Focus.
        Ceramics are predominantly Potomac Creek Cord-impressed types; projectile
        points are small triangles, usually of white quartz; a majority of the clay
        pipes are of the obtuse angle type; and there is a diversity of bone tools.
        Shell beads are numerous, especially in the ossuaries. Burials are predominantly
        secondary bundle burials, with a few articulated flexed or extended, and even
        fewer cremations. Coupled with evidence of long-term occupation of the site
        (e.g., six rebuildings of the palisade), there is evidence of evolving pottery
        types. The earliest ware equates closely with Shepard Cord-marked type of
        the Piedmont Potomac valley, and this evolves into the Potomac Creek Cord-impressed
        and Potomac Creek Plain wares typical of the early 17th century.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:41:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:59:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:41:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:59:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1992-11-27</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        Matthew Calbraith Perry's Japan Expedition (1853-1854) not only began a tradition
        of \"gunboat diplomacy\" so often associated with mid-nineteenth century American
        expansionism, it also initiated a new collection of \"artifacts of diplomacy\"--;historical,
        scientific, and ethnological materials that would become the first acquisition
        of Japanese artifacts by the former United States National Museum, now the
        National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. Commodore Perry
        practiced traditional diplomatic gift exchanges. The ethnological artifacts
        described in this catalog are, in the main, the reciprocal gifts to the United
        States government, President Franklin Pierce, the Commodore himself, and other
        members of the expedition party by Japanese government commissioners and by
        officials of the Kingdom of Ryukyu. They were received prior to and following
        the signing of The Treaty of Kanagawa on 31 March 1854. Also included are
        artifacts purchased at bazaars in Hakodate and Shimoda by some members of
        the expedition party for the specific purpose of expanding the collections
        of the United States National Museum. Descriptions of all known materials
        collected by individual expedition members as well as expedition-related graphics
        now in the Smithsonian Institution collections also have been included here.
        This study of the Japan Expedition collection, through the compilation of
        a catalog, provides a comprehensive chronicle of the collections. The chronicle
        records the expedition party's collecting activities, scenes of gift exchanges,
        and the assessments of the gifts, both positive and negative, made by Commodore
        Perry and others. It includes a history of previous exhibitions of portions
        of the collection. The catalog contains extensive documentation of the artifacts,
        with full descriptions based on both published and archival sources in English
        and Japanese. These descriptions, combined with the provenance of each object,
        provide a unique profile of mid-nineteenth century, preindustrial Japanese
        material culture.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:41:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:59:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:41:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T18:59:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995-05-31</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        Analysis of the human remains recovered from the tombs indicates the presence
        of at least 76 individuals. Data are presented to support archeological interpretations
        of mortuary procedure and social status of individuals. Cultural observations
        include perimortem sharp-force trauma, cranial deformation, interproximal
        grooves, and evidence of squatting postures on foot bones. Frequencies of
        skeletal indicators of pathology are low compared to other prehistoric samples
        from Ecuador, suggesting relatively good health. Biological evidence of status
        differences were largely confined to carbon isotopes, suggesting high-status
        individuals consumed more maize.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:42:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:42:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000-02-08</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        the Rainy Lake Chippewa at the Beginning of the 19th Century</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Hickerson,
        Harold</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The land tenure of northeastern Algonkians
        has been the subject of discussion and controversy over the past 50 years,
        since Speck first began describing family hunting territory systems among
        Algonquin and Chippewa of the Ottowa River valley (1914-15; 1915 a; 1915 b).
        The issue has boiled down to whether division of land among families or heads
        of families maintaining them in more or less permanent usufruct, and involving
        sanctions against trespass, was an aboriginal or postcontact form. I believe
        consensus now would hold that tenure based on small patrilocal family usufruct
        (the classic, but by no means universal form) is postcontact (cf. Driver,
        1961, pp. 249-250), but the precise form of tenure in aboriginal times would
        be a matter of doubt. Leacock (1954) quite conclusively demonstrated that
        family holdings came into existence as a result in subarctic cultures of emphasis
        on trapping fur for the European fur trade. Such emphasis, in brief, led to
        the husbanding of beaver and other sedentary game on an individual basis,
        replacing old communal large-game hunting patterns. The controversy over the
        aboriginality of the family tenure system relates to questions concerning
        the organization of primitives generally, and particularly to the question
        of the universality of primitive communism. This was recognized quite early
        in the discussion (Lowie, 1920, p. 211; Speck, 1922, pp. 83-84), and has been
        a tacit and at times explicit part of it ever since. I have discussed this
        at length in a review article (Hickerson, 1967). More recently, Rogers has
        argued that the question of land tenure should be separated from that of the
        constitution of social units (1963, pp. 77 ff.). On the basis of his assessment
        of ecological and socioreligious factors operating among the Mistassini Montagnais
        and other eastern subarctic peoples he has observed, Rogers suggests that
        a \"hunting group\" unit consisting of five or so linked biological families
        comprised the basic social unit for the area. The fur trade had the effect
        of tying such units to specific territories due to such factors as the need
        to conserve fur and fuel, ensure a game supply in a region of limited transportation
        facilities, provide mutual assistance in times of need, have available the
        counsel of respected elders, etc. Territorial stability for such units developed
        from the reliance on fur game, the supply of which had to be regulated and
        conserved by trapper-proprietors. If I understand Rogers correctly, in pretrade
        times when fur was not the chief object of the chase, the hunting groups were
        free to utilize range over which they held no exclusive rights. Without an
        allotment system, the bands were nevertheless restricted to roughly defined
        areas without set boundaries.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:37:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:37:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967-03-06</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        Songs Among the Oklahoma Cherokees</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Kilpatrick, Jack
        Frederick</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Kilpatrick, Anna Gritts</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Manuscript
        works on medicine and magic among the Oklahoma Cherokees sometimes contain
        idi:gaw\u0228:sdi (to be said, them, by one) or the texts of charm songs that,
        although written or partially written in the Sequoyah syllabary, are not in
        the Cherokee language. Cherokee din(a)da:hnvwi:sg(i) (those who cure them=equals;medicine
        men), who as a rule know no Indian language other than their own, are aware
        that such writings, in some instances handed down to them through several
        generations, are in either Creek or Natchez. But only rarely does one encounter
        a medicine man who thinks that he knows the meaning of a specific word here
        or there. More commonly he will not know even the general drift of what is
        written, and is not quite sure which particular grouping of syllables constitutes
        a word. But he does know that his saying or song is powerful--;\"alive,\"
        as he expresses it--;and there the matter rests. Since some of the phonemes
        of Muskogean languages are not found in Cherokee, a certain amount of ingenuity
        had to be exerted in representing them in the Sequoyah syllabary. The Sequoyan
        symbol for gwa, for example, may have been chosen to stand for pa. We have
        seen examples wherein new symbols had been created, or standard symbols reversed
        or inverted. We have also seen examples in which recourse to the English alphabet
        had been made in order to compensate for specific deficiencies in the Sequoyah
        syllabary. In addition to these Muskogean materials in the possession of din
        (a)da:hnvwi:sg(i), there is a corpus of charms, chiefly pertaining to hunting,
        that was once, and perhaps to a certain extent still is, employed by the laity.
        As pointed out in Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick (1967) for some reason as yet
        undetermined the aboriginal Cherokee hunting charms were largely supplanted
        by those of Muskogean origin. As one might expect, Muskogean medicomagic is
        most commonly encountered in the southern part of the territory of the Oklahoma
        Cherokees, a region containing several clearly defined and long-established
        Muskogean enclaves.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:37:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:37:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967-03-06</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        from Tranquillity, California</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Angel, J. Lawrence</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>From
        these speculations one can draw three conclusions, differing in certainty.
        The most certain one is that the first invaders from Asia, the Palaeamericans,
        migrating southward over a timespan of 5-10,000 years after the height of
        the last glaciation (Willey, 1961), split up into many slightly differing
        breeding isolates, whose divergences occurred more through sampling accidents
        (drift) than through selection. The kind of variability of the Tranquillity
        sample, especially the extreme in Burial 5, supports this picture. The least
        certain, conclusion concerns evolutionary selective pressures resulting from
        a tough meat diet and hard living conditions leading to a short lifespan.
        These pressures would put a high premium on the fertility of a few women,
        especially those having massive teeth to resist wear (cf. Brace, 1962). Possibly
        Mongoloid features are a result of such pressures. The source for this extra
        tooth and face size not yet fully developed in late Pleistocene East Asia
        might be a recombination of genes from a tropical Negritoid population (contributing
        canine plus incisor breadth and prognathism) with genes from Sinanthropus
        descendants like Mapa (Woo, 1959 b; Coon, 1962) contributing shovel incisors
        and face massiveness, and perhaps also with Upper Paleolithic \"White\" genes.
        Evolution from such a proto-Mongoloid blend in a Mongoloid direction would
        have occurred in both Asia and America after 20,000 B.C. Apparently this evolution
        went much further in Asia. The third conclusion concerns this difference in
        speeds of microevolution. The Tranquillity group in particular is still proto-Mongoloid
        and modern Hill Yokuts, Southern Miwok, and Western Mono appear to have changed
        little from it. Until very recently the tule-swamp character of the region
        had changed very little, except for the gradual (and late ?) extinction of
        most larger game mammals other than deer, and the ensuing wet phase. Regions
        of climatic and ecologic stability during the retreat of the last glaciation
        would probably be influenced by maritime climate and separated from the North
        or Plains areas. In contrast to this, Northeast Asia, the Bering Strait region,
        and northern North America underwent a series of climatic and sea level changes
        comparable to those of Europe and the Mediterranean. Here there took place
        an evolutionary change to a big-faced, large-headed fully Mongoloid norm,
        equivalent to the Upper Paleolithic to Alpine and Mediterranean change in
        Europe and the Near East. A little of this Mongoloid change was plausibly
        injected into America in early Mesolithic times, and again to form the Aleut-Eskimo
        people (Laughlin, 1963) before 6,000 B.C. Until we have more data on frequencies
        of key traits and complexes, it is hard to guess whether the American Indian
        in general has absorbed Asiatic genes to any extent in post-Pleistocene times:
        the probable relation of Diego blood type to a Palaeamerican distribution
        and the lack of type B in the New World suggest that there was little addition
        from Asia after the end of the Pleistocene. In that case we are faced with
        an interesting parallelism in evolution in a Mongoloid direction, with the
        slower rate of change in America partly explained by relative climatic stability
        of southern coastal, island, mountain, jungle, and woodland ecologic zones
        as opposed to northern coastal, plateau, and plains areas, even though the
        variety of American ecologic zones is wide.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:37:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:37:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1966-11-25</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        Process</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Williams, Aubrey W., Jr.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The
        purpose of this work is to describe the function of various political structures
        and their incorporation into the Navajo way of life. The data presented in
        this study were collected over a 2-year period--;January 1961 to December
        1963--;during which I spent 18 months on the Navajo Reservation and adjoining
        areas as a participant-observer of Navajo culture. The report was written,
        in part, while I was in the field in order to utilize both historical and
        contemporary documents maintained by the Navajo Tribe and the Bureau of Indian
        Affairs at Window Rock, Arizona. My introduction to contemporary Navajo life
        was as an employee of the Navajo Tribe in the capacity of an ethnographer.
        On January 1, 1961, I became a member of a research team seeking ethnohistorical
        facts from elderly Navajos to support a land claims case against the U.S.
        Government. On the afternoon of the day I arrived on the Navajo Reservation,
        I was \"presented\" with two 4-wheel-drive Jeeps, two tape recorders, two
        interpreters, four Navajo helpers, and a list of Navajo place names and personal
        names which I was to go out and locate and interview on the following day.
        I was told that I could spend the remainder of the afternoon securing food
        and provisions for my research team for a 3-week stay in the field. During
        the next 2 months nearly 150 informants over the age of 60 years were interviewed
        (a maximum of 14 on any single day) concerning the cultural patterns of their
        families and relatives as far back in time as each informant was able to remember.
        My work with the Navajo Tribe put me in contact with many tribal officials,
        traders, Bureau of Indian Affairs personnel, missionaries, grazing committee
        members, and chapter officers in all parts of the Navajo Reservation. The
        most frequent contact was with chapter officials; we frequently utilized chapter
        houses as temporary headquarters in our search for informants. In most cases
        it was necessary to obtain the approval of each chapter's officers before
        we were allowed to use chapter buildings for interviews and living quarters.
        I soon learned that obtaining this approval was no mere formality even though
        we had the general blessings of the Navajo Tribal Council and the approval
        of the tribal government to conduct such inquiries. Chapter officers almost
        invariably wanted to know a great deal about what we hoped to do with the
        information we were planning to collect, and why certain members of their
        chapter had been named as prospective informants. The independent spirit and
        actions of each chapter organization aroused my interest and resulted in the
        study presented here. I am indebted to a great many people for the information
        presented herein. Chronologically, I am grateful to David M. Brugge, J. Lee
        Correll, Clyde Peshlakai, Bernadine Whitegoat, and Maxwell Yazzi who first
        introduced and interpreted Navajo culture to me on the Navajo Reservation.
        I am indebted to John Y. Begaye and Ralph Johns who, as tribal employees,
        allowed me to pester both them and their staffs with questions about Navajo
        life for over 14 months. I owe a great debt to the hundreds of Navajo men
        and women who tried to answer my questions concerning the operation of their
        chapter organization. Thanks are due to Jane Erickson who helped in final
        proofreading and to Mary Anne Libby who assisted in indexing the study. My
        greatest debt is that which I owe to Edward H. Spicer who acted as the supervisor
        of my graduate studies in the Department of Anthropology at the University
        of Arizona. I feel certain that without his gentle but persistent demand for
        the highest possible quality of workmanship both in the field and in writing,
        the study would not contain what clarity it now possesses. The research for
        this paper was financially supported by a Comin's Fund Fellowship from the
        Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona, for the months of June,
        July, and August 1961, and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological
        Research fellowship awarded in June 1962. I am also indebted to the Bureau
        of Ethnic Research, Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona, for
        the appointment as a Research Assistant on their Navajo Project under the
        auspices of the National Cancer Institute in the months of October 1962 to
        May 1963. Finally, I wish to thank my wife, Rebecca, whose thoughtful evaluation
        and insight throughout the original formulation, during the many months of
        field work, and in the countless hours of first, second, and third rewriting
        phases of the work has been a constant inspiration throughout the total study.

        Forensic Anthropology Cases Submitted to the Smithsonian Institution by the
        Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1962 to 1994</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Grisbaum,
        Gretchen A.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Ubelaker, Douglas H.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>For
        more than 50 years, the Smithsonian Institution has provided scientific expertise
        in the analysis of forensic anthropology cases submitted to the Institution
        by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Washington, D.C. This study
        presents an analysis of the cases submitted from 1962 to 1994 and reported
        on by two Smithsonian scientists, J. Lawrence Angel and Douglas H. Ubelaker.
        Analysis revealed wide variation in the types of cases submitted. In addition,
        the rate of submission varied throughout this period, with the highest rate
        occurring in the late 1970s. The FBI submissions originated most commonly
        from western and southern regions of the United States and reflected original
        discoveries frequently in the months of May and November. The total sample
        included all major categories of ancestry, sex, and age, but the overall pattern
        deviated significantly from national homicide statistics. Statistics on taphonomical
        alterations, trauma, the area of the body associated with trauma, and problems
        of positive identifications in the FBI sample are discussed. Finally, temporal
        changes in report writing and information collected are discussed. These differences
        appear to reflect not only stylistic preferences of the two scientists involved,
        but also the academic growth of forensic anthropology. The patterns of change
        detected in the FBI sample relate to the more general expansion of forensic
        anthropology and the growing numbers of anthropologists involved in this application
        of physical anthropology.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:42:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:42:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:00:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001-03-23</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        \"Isleta Paintings\" in Pueblo Society</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Goldfrank,
        Ester S.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Pueblo society places a very considerable
        emphasis on knowledge, but it also dictates how this knowledge is to be acquired
        and used. Joe Lente was a rebel. In a society where, as one anthropologist
        put it, \"disobedience is a sacrilege and heresy as well as treason\" (White,
        1932, p. 11), he obviously was not attracted by the Pueblo road to recognition
        and power--;a priestly vocation--;and this despite his early involvement with
        \"ceremonial members\" (especially his father and grandfather) and ceremonial
        activities. Indeed he used his abilities in the very way that from his earliest
        years he had learned would surely bring dire punishment--;even death: he disclosed
        the most sacred and secret teachings of his society to an outsider. The wonder
        is that while he breached a basic principle of his society, that while his
        anxiety over this action never abated, he nevertheless chose to remain in
        Isleta, outwardly conforming, except when he was drunk, to its authoritarian
        mode of life.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:38:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:01:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:38:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:01:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967-08-04</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        and Dictionary</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Chafe, Wallace L.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>This
        work is an extended description of the structure of words in the Seneca language.
        A description of the grammar of Seneca words has already been published in
        the International Journal of American Linguistics (Chafe, 1960, 1961 a). A
        major omission from that work, however, was a comprehensive list of the verb
        roots, noun roots, and particles of the language, with specification of their
        grammatical peculiarities and examples of their use. The present work is designed
        to fill that gap. Its chief purpose is to make available a Seneca dictionary,
        or lexicon. Since, however, the dictionary contains many references to paragraphs
        in the Seneca Morphology mentioned above, it was thought useful to republish
        that work as part of this volume. Republication seems all the more useful
        in view of the fact that the original Seneca Morphology is scattered through
        eight numbers of two different volumes of the journal. Minor revisions and
        corrections have been made, but extensive changes, however desirable they
        might have been, were out of the question because the references in the dictionary
        were already keyed to paragraph numbers in the original version, as were the
        references given in the Grammatical Commentary of Seneca Thanksgiving Rituals
        (Chafe, 1961 b). Seneca is at present the native language of a few thousand
        persons, most of whom live on the Allegany, Cattaraugus, and Tonawanda Reservations
        in western New York State and on the Grand River Reserve in Ontario, Canada.
        There are few if any speakers now under 30 years of age. Seneca is historically
        important as the language of the Five (now Six) Nations of the Iroquois and
        as the language of Handsome Lake, the Iroquois prophet (Parker, 1913; for
        a history of the Seneca see Parker, 1926). Within the Iroquoian language family,
        Seneca is a member of the Northern Iroquoian subgroup, which includes also
        Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and Tuscarora among the languages still
        spoken. Seneca is most closely related to Cayuga, but the two are different
        enough to be considered separate languages. The dialect differentiation within
        Seneca itself is minor. Earlier works on Seneca include several brief grammatical
        sketches (Voegelin and Preston, 1949, and Holmer, 1952, 1953, 1954) and texts
        (Hewitt, 1903, 1918). A list of still earlier sources is available in Pilling
        (1888). The material on which this work is based was obtained during four
        summers of fieldwork, 1956-59, on the three New York reservations. It consists
        of an extensive corpus of Seneca words and texts, including formal speeches,
        legends, historical accounts, and conversations. I am deeply grateful for
        the assistance provided by numerous speakers of Seneca, above all by Solon
        Jones and Leroy Button of the Cattaraugus Reservation, Lena P. Snow, Tessie
        Snow, and Edward Curry of the Allegany Reservation, and Corbett Sundown and
        Betsy Carpenter of the Tonawanda Reservation. Appreciation is also due to
        William N. Fenton, Floyd G. Lounsbury, the Smithsonian Institution, Yale University,
        and especially to the New York State Museum and Science Service, under whose
        auspices the fieldwork was conducted. Both the Smithsonian Institution and
        the University of California provided support for the completion of the manuscript,
        and thanks are due to Karlena Glemser, Myra Rothenberg, and Aura Cuevas for
        their help in this regard. The lexicon of a language is a vast terrain which
        no one could hope to explore fully during a few scattered field trips. Although
        grammatical analysis can perhaps lead to a point of diminishing returns after
        a reasonable period of investigation, I doubt that such a point has even been
        approached for the vocabularies of any languages except those few which have
        a long tradition of lexicography. Certainly the experience which I and others
        have had with American Indian languages refutes the ethnocentric myth that
        such languages are poor in their means of expression. What is given in the
        dictionary of this work is simply what I was able to obtain in a period that
        was totally inadequate for the purpose. In making this lexical material available,
        I have had several possible uses of it in mind. I should say first that I
        have not intended that anyone should use it for learning to speak the Seneca
        language, although I would be very happy if someone were to find it helpful
        for that purpose. Above all I have wanted to provide data that can be used
        in comparative Iroquoian studies. Such work is stymied, as it is in most American
        Indian language families, by the absence of detailed lexical material. This
        is the first modern dictionary of any Iroquoian language, and I fervently
        hope that other and better ones will follow. Reconstruction, subgrouping,
        and the possible establishment of relationships outside the family cannot
        proceed without them. Second, the listing of roots with examples of their
        use will serve to elucidate the morphological patterns of the language beyond
        the few examples provided in the morphology, and to show something of the
        scope and frequency of constructions mentioned there. I regret the absence
        of syntactic examples; this compilation is a byproduct of a preoccupation
        with morphology. Examples of syntactic patterns as well as further morphological
        examples may be culled from my \"Seneca Thanksgiving Rituals\" and from Hewitt's
        texts. Finally, this material may prove useful in \"language and culture\"
        studies of various kinds.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:38:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:01:21Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:38:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:01:21Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967-06-28</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        History and Material Culture of the Tonkawa Indians</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Jones,
        William K.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>One of the litde-known tribes of
        central Texas was\nthe Tonkawa. Few objects made and used by the\nTonkawa
        are preserved in museum collections, and no\ndescription of traditional Tonkawa
        material culture,\nbased upon a study of actual specimens, has appeared\nin
        the literature. Nevertheless, a small but unique col\nlection of Tonkawa materials
        has been a part of the\nethnological collections of the Smithsonian Institution\nfor
        a century. It is unique, not only because it is the\nearliest known Tonkawa
        collection, antedating the\nextermination of the bison on the Southern Plains,\nbut
        also because the time, place, and conditions under\nwhich the collection was
        made in the field are well\ndocumented. In order to place this collection
        in a\nmeaningful cultural and chronological context I have\nprefaced my description
        of the specimens with a brief\nhistorical sketch of the Tonkawa, with particular\nemphasis
        upon the years immediately preceding the\nacquisition of these materials by
        Dr. McElderry at\nFort Griffin, Texas, in 1868.\n  Although the Tonkawa call
        themselves Titskan\nwdtitch, \"the most human people,\" the tribal name is\nderived
        from the Waco name for these people, Tonka\nweya, meaning \"they all stay
        together.\" The Co\nmanche and Kiowa, northwestern neighbors and\nlongtime
        enemies of the Tonkawa, knew them by\nnames which, in translation, meant \"man-eating\nmen\"
        or \"maneaters.\" The Tonkawan language\napparently was affiliated with Karankawa,
        Come\ncrudo, and Cotoname through the common Co\nahuiltecan stock, although
        too litde is known of the\nlanguages of those extinct tribes to establish
        with\ncertainty the closeness of their relationship to\nTonkawan.\nAvailable
        data on Tonkawa population, covering a\n\nperiod of nearly 200 years, indicate
        that the Tonkawa\nwere not a large tribe. A Spanish estimate in 1778\ngives
        300 warriors. Sibley estimated the Tonkawa at\nbut 200 men in 1805, and the
        tribal population con\ntinued to decline thereafter. Heavy war losses, epi\ndemics,
        and loss of tribal identity through marriages\noutside the tribe, as well
        as other factors, contributed\nto this decline. Of the sixty-two Tonkawa Indians\non
        the tribal rolls in 1961, only three individuals were\nbelieved to be fullblood
        Tonkawa. (Swanton, 1952,\np. 327; Hasskarl, 1962, p. 228.)\n  If archeological
        evidence of the Tonkawa exists,\nit may be represented in the Toyah Focus
        of the Central Texas Aspect. Dr, Edward B. Jelks states that if\nthe Toyah
        Focus material excavated at the Kyle Site,\nlocated on the Brazos River just
        above Whitney Dam\nin Hill County, Texas, can be related to a historic\ngroup,
        it is probably Tonkawa and/or Jumano. But\nhe also believes that this focus
        may have come to an\nend in the late prehistoric period and another, yet\nundescribed,
        group may have taken its place. This\nlater group, represented by triangular
        arrow points,\nGoliad Plain pottery, and other artifact styles, \"may\nrepresent
        the archeological remains of the historic\nand protohistoric Tonkawa . . .
        .\" Radiocarbon dates\nfrom the Toyah Focus at the Kyle Site range from\nA.D.
        1276 \xB1165 years to A.D. 1561 \xB1130 years.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:51:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:01:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:51:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:01:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1969-12-31</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        from the United States \"Transit of Venus Expedition,\" 1874-1875</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Keyes,
        Ian W.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>On Monday, June 8, 1874, just over 90
        years ago, the U.S. steamer Swatara, under Comdr. Ralph Chandler, U.S. Navy,
        sailed from New York Harbor--;her destination, the remote sub-Antarctic Crozet
        and Kerguelen Islands, Tasmania, New Zealand, and the Chatham Islands. Three
        years previously, in 1871, a committee that had been established under the
        authorization of the U.S. Congress (U.S. Navy, 1875, p. 16; Newcomb, 1880,
        p. 9) had completed earlier plans whereby a series of astronomical observatories
        would be established in various parts of the world during 1874, to conduct
        scientific observations on the \"transit of Venus\" scheduled to take place
        during December 9th of that year. Other countries also had formulated plans
        to send expeditions to suitable localities where that celestial event could
        most effectively be followed, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. In
        addition to the five scientific parties which the U.S. Government planned
        to send into southern waters, three stations were scheduled for the Northern
        Hemisphere; at Nagasaki, Peking, and Vladivostok (Newcomb, 1880, p. 12-13).
        The Swatara, with its complement of 26 astronomers and photographers, comprising
        the Southern Hemisphere contingent of the \"Transit of Venus Expedition\"
        along with stores, instruments, and equipment for establishing five observatories,
        set sail from New York for the 46\xD7 south latitude. The first call was at
        \"Bahia\" (Salvador, Brazil) on Friday, July 10 (Chandler, MS. a) from which
        the vessel proceeded to Cape Town where she arrived at Table Bay on Wednesday,
        August 5th. From here, on August 17th, she rounded the Cape of Good Hope heading
        east-southeastwards for the Crozet Islands where the first observation party
        was to be landed. However, the high winds and heavy seas that were encountered
        on August 31st when the islands were reached, precluded a landing, so the
        Swatara continued on her easterly course towards the Kerguelen group, the
        site selected for the next observatory. Three Island Harbor was reached on
        Monday, September 7th. A camp was established at the northern end of Royal
        Sound and the scientific party landed, equipped for a long stay both to carry
        out the astronomical observations and to conduct additional biotic studies
        of the island (Kidder, 1875, 1876). On September 13th, the Swatara departed
        and headed for Hobart, Tasmania, where the next observatory was due to be
        sited. At Hobart, on October 3d, equipment and stores were unloaded for establishing
        this station and the instruments and personnel of the Crozet party were landed
        so that an additional observatory might be established at Campbelltown (Newcomb,
        1880, p. 18). Bluff Harbor, Southland, New Zealand, was reached on Friday,
        October 16th, and the New Zealand party under Prof. C. H. F. Peters was met
        by Lieut. E. H. Bass (assistant astronomer to the New Zealand party), who
        had spent 2 weeks in the country selecting the most suitable site for the
        Transit observatory. The Swatara sailed from Bluff Harbor on Saturday, October
        17th, and after a brief stop off the Tairua Heads at the entrance to Port
        Chalmers, headed for the Chatham Islands. Chatham Island was reached on Monday,
        October 19th, and the final party of nine under Edwin Smith, the chief astronomer,
        disembarked at Port Hutt (northwest shore of Petre Bay), where a station was
        established on rising ground to the west of Whangaroa Bay. The Swatara sailed
        from Petre Bay on Monday, October 26th, for New Zealand, then to Hobart, where
        she remained until after the Transit.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:37:56Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:01:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:37:56Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:01:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967-03-06</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        of Ponape</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Riesenberg, Saul H.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The
        island of Ponape lies at 6\xD754' north latitude and 158\xD714' east longitude,
        near the eastern end of the archipelago that comprises the Caroline Islands.
        Ponape and the nearby atolls of Pakin and Ant constitute the Senyavin group.
        Kusaie, the next major island to the east and last of the Caroline chain,
        is 307 nautical miles distant; and Truk is 383 miles to the west. Ponape is
        about midway between Honolulu and Manila, 2,685 and 2,363 miles distant, respectively.
        The land area of Ponape as usually given is 334 square kilometers (129 square
        miles). Except for a few coastal plains and lower slopes, most of the island
        is ruggedly mountainous with several ranges and high peaks, the highest rising
        to 791 meters (nearly 2,600 feet), the highest peak in the Carolines. The
        mountain tops are often covered with cloud and mist. The island interior consists
        largely of basalt, with some andesite and other volcanic rock. The lower slopes
        and level areas are mostly sand and gravel. Here and there, most spectacularly
        on Sokehs Island, are high cliffs of columnar basalt, with columnar talus
        at their bases. Streams and waterfalls abound. The streams are very active
        after every rainfall and deposit alluvium in great flats. The main island
        is roughly circular in outline. About 20 square miles of its area consists
        of coastal mangrove swamp; there are few beaches. Surrounding the island is
        an encircling reef, distant from the coast about 2 miles on the average and
        broken here and there by passages between the lagoon and the open sea. Where
        the reef rises above sea level, some 15 coral islets are formed. The lagoon
        between the main island and the encircling reef is of varying depth and contains
        many heads of live coral that may rise close to the water surface. It occupies
        about 98 square miles of water and includes in it 23 small islands of the
        same volcanic materials as the main island. Also in the lagoon are a number
        of alluvial islands lying close to the shore and, in the east, off Temwen
        Island, some 90 artificial islets are grouped together that contain the well-known
        archeological ruins of Nan Madol. All of these smaller islands together occupy
        an area of about 5 square miles. Ponape, like the rest of the Carolines, is
        in the doldrum belt. This belt swings north May to July and south August to
        November, accompanied by stormy weather and heavy rain. The trade winds blow
        from the east December to April and move around more to the south the rest
        of the year. Typhoons are much less common than in western Micronesia. Relative
        humidity is high; the monthly averages are 79 to 91 percent and are lowest
        in March and April. Rainfall is very heavy and is rather uniform throughout
        the year, though somewhat less in January to March. The annual average precipitation
        is 178 inches. The monthly temperature means are from 78\xD7 to 82\xD7 F.,
        the extremes are 68\xD7 and 92\xD7 F. The extensive mangrove swamps that line
        much of the low shore consist of Sonneratia, Rhizophora, Bruguiera, Lumnitzera,
        Xylocarpus, Heritiera, and also Nypa palm. Strand vegetation occurs largely
        on the reef islands and where the land of the main island starts to rise inland
        of the mangroves. Behind the strand and mangroves is a narrow strip of coastal
        plain vegetation, originally primary rain forest but now mainly occupied by
        single dwellings or small clusters of buildings and by cultivated areas. (Very
        few localities on Ponape can properly be called villages.) The cultivated
        areas contain coconut groves, banana, breadfruit, citrus, sweet potatoes,
        manioc, aroids (Cyrtosperma, Alocasia, and Colocasia), and a few other cultivated
        plants of less importance, as well as such trees as Ficus, Calophyllum, Terminalia,
        ivory nut palm, Pandanus, Macaranga, Morinda, and Hibiscus, with some grasses
        and undergrowth. The rain forest is very dense and rich. Ponape has the most
        extensive native forests in Micronesia. Uninterrupted jungle covers most of
        the interior and reaches to the coast in a few places. The forest covers most
        of the steep slopes and summits and some lowlands. The lower primary forests
        contain large trees, palms, climbers, ferns, orchids, and other epiphytes.
        On the slopes where rain forest has been destroyed there are mixed coconut
        and breadfruit groves, also bananas, Alocasia, and some shrubbery. The montane
        rain forests consist of scrubby, mossy woods on the steep slopes and ridges,
        where the soil is thin. Tree ferns, Exorrhiza and Ponapea palms, Freycinetia,
        and many stunted broad-leaved trees bearing epiphytes predominate. On the
        high open crests are dwarfed shrubs, dwarfed Exorrhiza, tree ferns, dense
        growths of Pandanus, or open bogs. Grassland is rare. According to Baker (1951)
        some 39 species of birds occur on Ponape, including sea birds, migratory shore
        birds, and land and fresh water birds. Among the species are a heron, a duck,
        seven of the snipe-sandpiper family, six gulls and terns, two doves and a
        pigeon, a lory, an owl, a kingfisher, two flycatchers, two starlings, three
        white-eyes, and two weaver finches. Insects are numerous but comprise only
        a small number of genera. The only land reptiles are a few species of lizard.
        There were only three mammals, aboriginally: rats, bats, and dogs; pigs were
        introduced in very early postcontact times, and some are now feral, as are
        the deer brought in during German times. In contrast, the lagoon is rich in
        fishes, mollusks, crustacea, and other marine fauna, including two kinds of
        turtles.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:38:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:38:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1968-12-31</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        monograph presents the historical context and detailed descriptions of a remarkable
        collection of more than 20,000 artifacts from the Craig Mound at the Spiro
        site in eastern Oklahoma. Spiro is one of the key sites known for the Mississippian
        Period (ad 900\u20131500) of the eastern United States. Aside from the cultural
        importance of the site in regional history, the artifacts from Spiro provide
        an almost unique glimpse into the ceremonial life and artistic innovations
        of a people who developed an important\nbut poorly known cultural tradition.
        Between 1933 and 1936 the Spiro site was looted, and artifacts were sold and
        traded to many collectors. Subsequently, professional archaeological excavations
        were conducted, and those collections primarily reside at the Sam Noble Oklahoma
        Museum of Natural History. The Smithsonian Spiro collection is under the care
        of the Department of\nAnthropology at the National Museum of Natural History.
        The collection came to the Museum through 14 accessions between 1936 and 1986.
        The largest portion was acquired from Harry M. Trowbridge in 1958. Of particular
        note in the collection are marine shells engraved with a wide variety of human
        and animal images. The collection also includes pigments, basketry, clothing
        with dyed designs, pipes, weapons, ornaments, containers, and figurines made
        from several different materials. Many of the artifacts are made from raw
        materials that were acquired by the Spiro people through an extensive trade
        network extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and from the upper
        Midwest in the north to central Mexico in the south.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2011-11-21T21:08:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:13Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2011-11-21T21:08:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:13Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2011-11-21</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        Paleolithic and the Development of a National Collection</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Petraglia,
        Michael</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Potts, Richard</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Beginning
        with the first accession of Paleolithic collections in 1869,\nthe Smithsonian
        Institution and its scientific staff have shown great interest in pursuing\nresearch,
        education, and exhibition of early human lifeways. During the more than 130-year\nhistory
        of acquiring objects from the Old World, a total of 22,000 objects has been
        amassed\nfrom some 332 Lower to Upper Paleolithic localities. Certain objects
        are rare pieces from clas-\nsic Paleolithic localities, although many others
        were obtained as representative pieces for com-\nparative purposes and exhibition.
        Documents and letters of correspondence between Old and\nNew World investigators
        provide the historical context of collection acquisition and the moti-\nvations
        of those involved in the international transfer and exchange of artifacts.
        Synthesis of\nthe documentation shows variability in the tempo of collection
        acquisition and biases in geo-\ngraphic interests that are tied to patterns
        of scientific inquiry, world wars, and later, adherence\nto antiquity laws
        and reorientation of modern paleoanthropological methods and approaches.\nBecause
        we refer extensively to archived letters and memoranda in the text, Appendix
        1 pro-\nvides a chronological list of these materials and the specific Smithsonian
        Institution archive\nwhere they are located.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:57:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:57:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        the Pawnee, Part I: The Skiri</dc:title>\n<dc:contributor>Murie, James R.</dc:contributor>\n<dc:contributor>Parks,
        Douglas R.</dc:contributor>\n<dc:description>In 1910 Murie, James R., an educated
        Pawnee who had previously worked with various anthropologists (most notably
        Alice C. Fletcher and George A. Dorsey), was given a grant by the Bureau of
        American Ethnology to prepare a full account of surviving Pawnee religious
        ceremonies. Shortly afterward he began work under the direction of Clark Wissler,
        with whom he planned a comprehensive description of the ritualism of the Skiri
        band. This monograph, written by Murie in collaboration with Clark Wissler,
        is the combined result of the two projects, which extended over a decade.
        It is a detailed presentation of the essential features of Pawnee ceremonialism.
        The first part presents the annual cycle of Skiri ceremonial life, minutely
        describing most of the rituals as well as the role and functions of sacred
        bundles in the culture. The second part includes accounts of three surviving
        South Band ceremonies that Murie witnessed: the White Beaver Ceremony (or
        Doctor Dance) of the Chawi band, and the Bear and Buffalo dances of the Pitahawirata
        band. In each of the accounts the songs of the ceremony are given in both
        Pawnee and English. Together they constitute one of the most extensive song
        collections for any North American tribe. For the three South Band ceremonies,
        the vision stories underlying the songs are also presented. The manuscript,
        scheduled for publication on several occasions in the 1920s and 1930s, has
        been in the archives of the Bureau of American Ethnology since 1921. It is
        here presented in edited form, together with revised linguistic transcriptions
        and translations, notes, an expanded bibliography, a biography of Murie, and
        two indexes.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:40:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:40:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1981-10-15</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        of Human Remains from La Tolita, Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Ubelaker,
        Douglas H.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Although much of the archeological
        site of La Tolita has been\ndestroyed by decades of looting, excavations begun
        in 1982 by the Banco Central of Quito,\nEcuador, located undisturbed areas
        and recovered relatively large samples of human remains\nrepresenting both
        primary and secondary burials from various areas of the site. These generally\ncan
        be dated within the La Tolita Temprano (600 BC to 200 BC), La Tolita Clasico
        (200 BC to\n90 AD), and the La Tolita Tardio (90 AD to 400 AD) periods.\n
        \ Analysis indicated at least 88 individuals to be present: 7 Temprano, 32
        Clasico, and 49\nTardio. Evidence for limited cranial deformation, flesh removal
        and dismemberment, and\nmanufacturing artifacts from human bone were detected.
        The temporal transition from Clasico\nto Tardio involved reduction of trauma,
        dental caries, the ratio of immatures to adults, the male\nmean age at death,
        and periosteal lesions, coupled with increases in living stature, porotic\nhyperostosis,
        congenital disorders, and enamel hypoplasia. Compared to other archeologically\nrecovered
        samples from early Ecuador, the La Tolita remains indicate a well-nourished,
        healthy\npopulation who experienced high levels of skeletal trauma.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:57:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:57:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:02:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1997-05-15</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        Edwin N.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Roberts, Frank H. H., Jr.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The
        excavation and analysis of Paleo-Indian artifacts from the Lindenmeier site
        in northern Colorado are described in detail. The site was excavated from
        1934 to 1940 by Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.; the history of these excavations
        is summarized. Roberts died in 1966 without completing an analysis of the
        excavated materials. In the same year, Wilmsen began work on the collection.
        The goals and strategies of the original work, as well as methods employed
        in the field, are reconstructed to the extent permitted by existing archival
        materials and publications. A detailed discussion of the physiographic features
        of the site location and of its Recent geologic history is presented. It is
        suggested that common stream meander processes are responsible for the present
        appearance of the site and that appeals to climatic change are unnecessary.
        The floral and faunal composition of the area at the time of Folsom occupation
        is considered in terms of preserved samples of soil, charcoal, resin, and
        pollen, along with molluskan and mammalian remains. A new radiocarbon age
        is reported and compared with an age reported previously by Haynes and Agogino
        (1960). These two ages are compared according to the method proposed by Long
        and Rippiteau (1974) and found to be indistinguishable statistically. The
        bulk of the report is devoted to an analysis of the stone artifacts in the
        collection. A method for assessing the comparability of measurements of artifacts
        made by different observers is introduced. This method also yields a basis
        for estimating the accuracy of observations and for rejecting a statistical
        result obtained from these observations. The artifacts are analyzed both in
        terms of sets of technological and functional variables and of their spatial
        clustering. Technologically, the artifacts are found to conform to the predictions
        of the wave model proposed by Speth (1972). Five major categories are defined
        in terms of functional variables. The spatially discrete sets of artifacts
        are found to be identical technologically and to possess only minor functional
        differences. These clusters are interpreted to be the debris remains of camps
        occupied periodically by socially and economically interacting units. Stylistic
        variation among projectile points is found to be highly significant and spatially
        discrete. These findings are used to support a hypothesis of social segmentation
        among the early inhabitants of the site.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:40:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:03:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:40:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:03:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1978-03-06</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        of the Numa: The John Wesley Powell Collection, 1867-1880</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Fowler,
        Don D.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Matley, John F.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Between
        1867 and 1880 John Wesley Powell made collections of material culture items
        from several Numic-speaking Indian groups in the Great Basin and Colorado
        Plateau regions of the western United States. The collections were made in
        conjunction with Powell's ethnographic studies of those groups (Fowler and
        Fowler, eds., 1971). The USNM (United States National Museum) collections,
        on deposit in the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution,
        were studied by the authors in 1967-1968. The items described herein represent
        approximately one-half of the total collections. The remainder were deposited,
        on an exchange basis, in other major museums in the United States and abroad
        in the latter portion of the 19th century. Several individual items, or classes
        of items, from the USNM collections, were described by various authors of
        comparative studies of American Indian material culture in the late 19th and
        early 20th centuries. However, the full range of items in the collections
        has not been described previously. The bulk of the items were collected by
        Powell from various Southern Paiute or Northern Ute bands; the remainder from
        the Deep Creek Gosiute, and Goose Creek, Bear River and Wind River Shoshoni.
        The items reflect cultures in the early stages of acculturation to the intrusive
        Euroamerican cultures. The value of the collections is enhanced by photographs
        taken, principally in 1873 and 1874, by John K. (Jack) Hillers, Powell's photographer.
        The photographs show various items being worn or used by their makers. With
        the exception of Powell's studies and collections, systematic ethnographic
        work among Numic-speaking Indian peoples was not undertaken until the 1920s
        or later. By that time, much knowledge of, and use of, aboriginal crafts had

        Alaska: Its Place in the Birnirk and Thule Cultures</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Stanford,
        Dennis J.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>An archeological survey directed by
        the author near Point Barrow, Alaska, during the summer of 1968 resulted in
        the discovery of Walakpa, a deeply stratified coastal Eskimo site. It contained
        over 20 occupation levels, showing the development of Eskimo culture from
        Birnirk to Thule, as well as earlier and later Eskimo occupation levels. On
        the basis of excavations at Walakpa during 1968 and 1969, previous estimates
        of Birnirk and Thule origins are reexamined and a new interpretation of the
        genesis of this Eskimo culture proposed. Specifically, on the basis of the
        Point Barrow excavations, this monograph (1) examines the development of the
        Birnirk and Thule Eskimo cultures and (2) provides definitions for the horizon
        markers for each of the Eskimo stages represented at Walakpa. As a result
        of this detailed study, the author concludes that (1) Birnirk developed out
        of Old Bering Sea; (2) Birnirk can be divided into three phases: Early, A.D.
        500-700, Middle, A.D. 700-800, and Late, A.D. 800-900; (3) Thule Eskimo culture
        developed directly out of Birnirk; and (4) the development from Birnirk to
        Thule took place because of over-utilization of seals as the primary food
        resource and a change to a warmer climatic regime that further depleated the
        already weak seal resource, resulting in an increased use of whales for food
        and an expansion of hunting territories to the east.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:39:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:03:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:39:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:03:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1976-12-01</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        A Post-Contact Coalescent Site on the Northeastern Plains</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Wood,
        W. Raymond</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Biesterfeldt is a fortified village
        of about sixty earth lodges on the Sheyenne River in eastern North Dakota.
        A large central earth lodge faces a central plaza, with dwellings randomly
        set elsewhere in the village. The site setting, village plan, and structures
        are like those of historic Mandan and Arikara villages. Pottery attributes
        are well within the range of sedentary Missouri River groups, and only a few
        elements distinguish Biesterfeldt pottery from that of the Arikara. The site
        is dated about 1750 to 1790, when trade goods had displaced many native tools
        of bone and stone. In the thirty years since W. D. Strong dug the site, new
        data have accumulated which require revisions in the interpretation of the
        Biesterfeldt component: the artifact complex conforms to that of Post-Contact
        Coalescent sites of the Plains Village pattern in the Missouri River trench
        to the west. The identification of Biesterfeldt as Cheyenne is based on circumstantial
        evidence; its occupants are uncertain, but the Cheyenne provide the most economical
        hypothesis. The Cheyenne migration from the Minnesota area was by individual
        groups, not as a tribal body. Sedentary villages on the Minnesota River and
        on the Missouri were coeval with the village (or villages) on the Sheyenne
        River. The latter river valley was occupied after 1700, perhaps by 1724, and
        was abandoned about 1790. Present data suggest the Sheyenne-James region was
        a marginal one in the Northeastern Plains sub-area. It was not occupied by
        groups moving from the Missouri valley; rather, horticultural groups in the
        Northeastern Plains may have been subjected to cultural processes analogous
        to those which were responsible for the development of the Coalescent tradition
        in the Missouri valley. Thus, they participated in the development of the
        Plains Village pattern in an area well removed from the Missouri River, where
        the Coalescent tradition reached its fullest expression. The Missouri River
        was crossed by some Cheyenne in the 1600s, and the last of them abandoned
        it about 1840, providing about two centuries for the tribe as a whole to abandon
        a settled horticultural way of life. A review of purported Cheyenne sites
        along the Missouri River reveals that none of them are clearly identifiable
        as such. Only three of these village locations are not now flooded by the
        Oahe Reservoir: one of them is near the Heart River, and two are on the Grand
        River. The Cheyenne movement onto the High Plains was motivated by settling
        an area advantageous for trade purposes, rich in bison, and temporarily removed
        from military pressure by the Dakota.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:39:12Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:05:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:39:12Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:05:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1971-08-17</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        of our knowledge of the ethnology, material culture, and prehistory of the
        Plains of the United States can be linked with the careers and careful research
        of the Smithsonian's John C. Ewers and Waldo R. Wedel. Following their retirement,
        the Smithsonian chose to recognize their outstanding contributions to science
        by sponsoring a two-day symposium in their honor. The essays in this volume
        result from that symposium and are designed to illuminate both the diversity
        of their interests and the intensity of their research efforts. Biographical
        sketches of both men are provided by William N. Fenton and James H. Gunnerson,
        followed by their complete bibliographies. Smithsonian historical perspective
        is added by T.D. Stewart. The remaining essays focus on original research
        that relates to their career interests conducted by individuals whom they
        have influenced. These authors and their subjects are Parks, Douglas R. on
        the scalped man character in Arikara and Pawnee folklore, Thomas R. Wessel
        on problems of adaptation among the Blackfeet Indians, Loretta Fowler on political
        developments among the Northern Arapahoe and Gros Ventres, Hugh A. Dempsey
        on the nature of band organization among nonhorticultural Plains Indians,
        James A. Hanson on the evolution of Plains garments during the years of initial
        Indian White contact, Mildred Mott Wedel on the historical ethnology of the

        A Late Integration Period Burial Site on the South Coast of Ecuador</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Ubelaker,
        Douglas H.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Excavation of a\nMilagro Phase Integration
        Period cemetery in 1972 and 1973 on the southern\ncoast of Ecuador yielded
        54 large funerary urns (AD 730-AD 1730) and 25\nprimary and two secondary
        burials (500 BC-AD 1155) located outside ofthe\nurns. Radiocarbon dates were
        obtained from charcoal and bone collagen and\ntheir validity is discussed.
        The urn burials with inverted urn coverings are\nsimilar to those reported
        from other Milagro Phase cemetery sites in Guayas\nand Los Rios Provinces.
        The urns at the Ayalan cemetery contained secondary\nskeletal remains of as
        many as 25 persons per urn (average of about nine\npersons per urn) along
        with artifacts, such as ceramic jars, plates and com-\npoteras, beads of shell,
        stone, and pottery, ear and nose rings of copper, silver,\nand gold, triangular
        copper plates (axe money), and small spheres of lead\nwith copper inserts.
        Similar artifacts were found associated with the burials\noutside of the urns.\n
        \ Detailed data are presented on archeological features, artifacts, and such\nbiological
        subjects as demography, pathology, cranial measurements, non-\nmetric observations,
        and cultural practices registered in bone. Cultural differ-\nences between
        the urn features and the earlier non-urn features are minimal.\nBiological
        data shared by urn and non-urn samples include cranial deforma-\ntion, reconstructed
        living stature, and porotic hyperostosis. The urn sample\nshows greater life
        expectancy at birth, lower infant mortality, greater adult\nlife expectancy
        (especially in females), higher frequencies of foot bone altera-\ntions (probably
        indicating kneeling posture), vertebral osteophytosis, arthritic\nlipping
        at the knee, dental caries, alveolar abscesses, dental hypoplasia, and\nevidence
        of infectious disease. On the other hand, the urn sample shows fewer\nlines
        of increased density, fewer healed fractures, a lower frequency of joint\ndegeneration
        (although more severe examples), and less dental calculus. An\nappendix by
        Brian Hesse, \"The Association of Animal Bones with Burial\nFeatures,\" examines
        the faunal remains associated with the burial features.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:55:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:07:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-29T12:55:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:07:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1981-04-07</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian

        their ceremonial system (\"religion\") and practice of ritual, with its sanctioning
        mythology, provides background for the discussion of the sandpaintings of
        the Shootingway chantway, its Mountain-Shootingway phase, and its Evilway

        Shootingway relates its major mythic motifs to the following account of the
        symbols and designs of its sandpaintings. Special attention is given to the
        rarely performed Sun's House phase of male Shootingway and the double sandpainting,
        Sky-reaching Rock, the most elaborate of all sandpainting designs, which is
        especially associated with this phase. Finally, there is a detailed descriptive
        catalog of the 28 reproductions of Navaho sandpaintings in the Mrs. Charles
        D. Walcott Collection, now in the United States National Museum.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:38:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:08:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2007-05-25T17:38:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-14T19:08:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970-06-11</dc:date>\n<dc:identifier>Smithsonian
