        magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important analytical
        tools for organic and biological chemistry. It provides not only detailed
        information on the structure of small molecules and macromolecules, but also
        on molecular interactions. Because of the inherent low sensitivity of NMR,
        a long signal averaging time or a high spin concentration is often required.
        A variety of methods have been explored to improve the sensitivity of NMR.
        Especially, large signal gains can be obtained by hyperpolarization of the
        nuclear spins. NMR signals of hyperpolarized samples are enhanced by several
        orders of magnitude. Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (D-DNP) is a
        versatile technique capable of polarizing many different nuclei in the solid
        state, and subsequently providing a hyperpolarized liquid sample following
        a dissolution step. The resulting signal enhancement has made it possible
        to obtain detailed information in research fields as varied as metabolic imaging
        or enzyme catalysis. This dissertation aims to extend the applicability of
        D-DNP into new areas of chemistry, which involve the characterization of interactions
        and reactions involving large molecules.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nIn a first project,
        fluorine hyperpolarization is exploited to investigate protein-ligand interactions.
        The enhancement of 19F signal allows for the detection of submicromolar concentrations
        of fluorinated ligands in the strong-, intermediate-, and weak-binding regimes.
        Several NMR parameters are utilized to observe ligand binding to the macromolecule,
        and to determine dissociation constants.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nIn a second project,
        competitive binding of ligands to the same binding pocket on a protein is
        investigated. Here, polarization flows from a first ligand hyperpolarized
        on protons to the protein, and then to the second ligand. The buildup in function
        of time of the signals due to this relayed nuclear Overhauser effect contains
        structural information on the binding epitope.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nIn a third project,
        the aim is to directly detect a larger molecule, a polymer, which has been
        synthesized starting from hyperpolarized monomers. Using DNP, single scan
        observation of 13C, a common nucleus with large chemical shift dispersion,
        is possible. Time resolved 13C NMR spectroscopy in combination with kinetic
        models permits the description of polymerization reaction of the living anionic
        polymerization of styrene. In summary, several approaches have been investigated
        for utilizing a large hyperpolarization initially produced on small molecules,
        for the benefit of characterizing properties of macromolecules. These developments
        extend the capabilities of D-DNP and demonstrate the potential for leading
        to new applications in fields as diverse as drug discovery and polymer science.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2013-10-03T14:41:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-01T05:57:09Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-03-13</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        Effect of a 90 Degree Elbow on the Accuracy of Liquid Flow Measurement with
        an Insertion Flowmeter</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Woo, Seongwoo</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>To
        quantify the measurement error of slow meters in the developing length, simulation
        model development, local velocity measurements, flowmeters test, and regression
        model development were carried out for 10.2 cm, 15.2 cm, and 20.3 cm pipe
        system. The test facility used was the flow loop at Riverside campus, Texas
        A&amp;M University.  The test section was made on the basis of ASME guidelines
        (1971).&#xd;\nSimulation models were developed using Fluent/UNS to estimate
        the velocity contours in the developing length of 10.2 cm, 15.2 cm and 20.3
        cm. for evaluation of the standard deviation and the non-dimensional velocity
        contour data, the developing length of 10.2 cm, 15.2 cm, and 20.3 cm pipe
        with pressure fitting 9short radius of curvature) was 6 diameters downstream.
        For 10.2 cm with a long radius of curvature elbow, it was 10 diameters downstream
        of the elbow. &#xd;\nThe local velocity at 2 and 9 diameters downstream was
        measured with the help of a five0hole probe. The distorted velocity profile
        was distorted to the outside of pipe at 2 diameters downstream and 0 degrees.
        It had a double peak at 90 degrees and 2 diameters downstream. For 10.2 cm
        with a pressure fitting, the developing length was 6 diameters downstream.
        On the other hand, it was 9 to 10 diameters for 10.2 cm with the long radius
        of curvature. For 10.2 cm and 15.2 piping system with pressure fittings, the
        largest measurement error was -25% and -40% at 2D and 180 degrees. On the
        other hand, for the 102 cm pipe with R = 11.4 and 16.5cm, the largest measurement
        error was -15% at 2D and 180 degrees. The measurement error decreases exponentially
        or quadratically.&#xd;\nFinally, regression models were developed on the basis
        of the data trends of simulation, five-hole, and flowmeters data. The measurement
        error of simulation results, five-hole, and flowmeters data decreased quadratically
        or exponentially in the developing length. Exponential model was well described
        in the re0developing and fully developing region for 0 and 180 degrees flowmeters
        orientation. On the other hand, the data at 90 degrees was fluctuating and
        converging at zero.&#xd;\n.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-13T16:05:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-13T16:05:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/154783</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>ESL-TH-00-08-02;</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>Energy

        and Validation of a Computer Model for Energy-Efficient Shaded Fenestration
        Design</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Oh, Kie Whan</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The
        goal of this study is to develop and validate a computerized model for an
        energy? efficient  fenestration system that can easily be incorporated into
        the architectural design process. This model is for the thermal analysis of
        a shaded fenestration system and considers selected effects of the solar shades.
        Several simulation programs have been developed for the thermal analysis of
        a shaded window system.  However, none of the previous programs has incorporated
        a validated simulation model into a visually effective display such as a sunpath
        diagram.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe proposed methodology concentrates on the development
        of various new graphical aids tor effectively displaying a shaded design and
        develops a thermal model for calculating the heat transfer through an unshaded
        window at any orientation. A computerized simulation model, called the Shaded
        Fenestration Design (SFD) model, was developed that is capable of calculating
        \ the amount of solar radiation for a clear day as well as calculating the
        heat transfer through window glazing. The SFD model also provides new computerized
        displays of the sunpath diagrams that include the equidistant, orthographic,
        stereographic, gnomonic, and cylindrical projections, as well as the accompanying
        shading mask protractors.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe program simulates clear sky solar
        radiation for locations in the U.S. using the methods developed by the ASHRAE
        Handbook, Duffie and Beckman, and Kreider and Rabl. An&#xd;\nanisotrophic
        sky model was applied for the calculation of solar radiation on a tilted surface
        and the transmitted  solar radiation through the single-glazed window.&#xd;\nA
        highly insulated experimental test box was constructed to measure the total
        heat gain through the window glazing as well as the amount of solar radiation
        on the vertical surface. A finite difference model was then developed to provide
        a comparative validation. The results from the proposed solar simulation model
        were also compared against the simulated results from the DOE-2 program.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe
        portions of the work that represent new contributions include: l) computerization
        of the four projection methods (i.e.? orthographic. stereographic. gnomonic.
        and cylindrical projections)  for the sunpath diagram and the shading mask
        protractor, 2) display of the hourly intensity of solar data onto the path
        of the sun for horizontal and vertical orientations at varying&#xd;\noff-south
        azimuths, 3) use of a moveable viewpoint for the sunpath diagram, and 4) development
        \ of experimental  test sets of the measured heat gain for various shading
        configurations.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-13T16:15:19Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-13T16:15:19Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/154784</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>ESL-TH-00-05-01;</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>Texas

        Real Time Self-Tuning Algorithm for PI Control of the Heating and Cooling
        Coils in Buildings</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Zhou, Qianghua</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Proportional
        and Integral (PI) controllers are used widely in HVAC applications. It is
        necessary to choose suitable values for PI gains for PI control of the heating
        \ and cooling coils in buildings. Consequently, suitable indoor comfort can
        be maintained; the energy efficiency of the heating and cooling systems will
        be maximized; and the lifetime of heating and cooling valves will be prolonged.&#xd;\nA
        self-tuning algorithm is developed in this dissertation to find the good P
        and I gains.  The  proposed  algorithm  evaluates  the  controller  performance
        \ by  the  integral square error (ISE) of the coil supply air temperature.
        The controller operation will be considered as not suitable when the ISE is
        too big. The P and I gains are required to change at this condition. The algorithm
        uses the ?iteration' concept to find better values for P and I gains. It first
        changes the P and I gains to certain values to decrease the ISE. The iteration
        then will stop if the ISE is small enough; otherwise the change of the P and&#xd;\nI
        \  gains will continue   until optimal values are found.  Further, the new
        algorithm determines the iteration direction by observing the spectrum distribution
        of the ISE. P and I gains will be increased if the low frequency content is
        the dominant part in the coil supply air temperature; P and I gains will be
        decreased if high frequency content is the dominant part.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe
        new algorithm can be realized on-line without interrupting the coil normal
        operation. It functions as a watchdog to be sure the PI controller maintains
        smooth and rapid tracking properties. The new algorithm only requires about
        forty lines of program code in the current Direct Digital Control (DOC) systems
        used for HVAC control. The basic concept of the algorithm will be developed
        by theoretically analyzing the dynamic behavior and frequency characteristics
        of the cooling and heating coils in buildings. The whole algorithm is then
        demonstrated by controlling a coil in a building, thus proving its feasibility.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-13T20:18:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-13T20:18:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/154787</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:publisher>Texas

        \ baselining  hourly  energy  use  mainly  comprises  a simple  inverse  bin
        procedure (steps one through seven) and two improvements through the use of
        thermal  lag and humidity  sub-binning (steps eight through eleven).&#xd;\nTemperature-based
        binning  for baselining or modeling  weather  dependent  energy use  (e.g.,

        \ research in the analysis  community while  keeping   the  method  simple
        \ enough   to  be  usable  by  an  HVAC   engineer.   The inclusion  of multiple
        change points (i.e., bins)  through  the use of 5?F (-3?C) bins enables fitting

        \ model's  fit significantly over  the  existing  linear  and  change-point
        methods.  The additional   use of humidity sub-binning and lagged temperature
        as independent variables for sub-binning improves the predictions for latent
        load dominated building loads or buildings with high thermal mass constitution,
        respectively.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-13T20:22:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-13T20:22:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/154788</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>ESL-TH-99-05-02;</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>Texas

        of mobile health apps are now available for use on mobile phones for a variety
        of uses and conditions, including cancer survivorship. Many of these apps
        appear to deliver health behavior interventions but may fail to consider design
        considerations based in human computer interface and health behavior change
        theories.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nObjective&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThis study is designed to assess
        the presence of and manner in which health behavior change and health communication
        theories are applied in mobile phone cancer survivorship apps.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nMethods&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe
        research team selected a set of criteria-based health apps for mobile phones
        and assessed each app using qualitative coding methods to assess the application
        of health behavior change and communication theories. Each app was assessed
        using a coding derived from the taxonomy of 26 health behavior change techniques
        by Abraham and Michie with a few important changes based on the characteristics
        of mHealth apps that are specific to information processing and human computer
        interaction such as control theory and feedback systems.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults&#xd;\n&#xd;\nA
        total of 68 mobile phone apps and games built on the iOS and Android platforms
        were coded, with 65 being unique. Using a Cohen?s kappa analysis statistic,
        the inter-rater reliability for the iOS apps was 86.1 (P&lt;.001) and for
        the Android apps, 77.4 (P&lt;.001). For the most part, the scores for inclusion
        of theory-based health behavior change characteristics in the iOS platform
        cancer survivorship apps were consistently higher than those of the Android
        platform apps. For personalization and tailoring, 67% of the iOS apps (24/36)
        had these elements as compared to 38% of the Android apps (12/32). In the
        area of prompting for intention formation, 67% of the iOS apps (34/36) indicated
        these elements as compared to 16% (5/32) of the Android apps.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusions&#xd;\n&#xd;\nMobile
        apps are rapidly emerging as a way to deliver health behavior change interventions
        that can be tailored or personalized for individuals. As these apps and games
        continue to evolve and include interactive and adaptive sensors and other
        forms of dynamic feedback, their content and interventional elements need
        to be grounded in human computer interface design and health behavior and
        communication theory and practice.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The open

        To investigate African-American fathers? (AAF) perceptions regarding the applicability
        and need for their involvement as a health connection for their children and
        describe how participating fathers? behavior was affected by their attitudes,
        knowledge, and perceptions of their influence on their children?s health.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nMethods:
        This exploratory study gathered data via semi-structured focus groups (n =
        3) and thematically analyzed it utilizing a grounded theory approach. Participants
        included AAF (n = 20) with a mean age of 37 years (SD 11.79), with at least
        one child between 6 and 18 years old.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults: Four major themes
        were revealed: (1) appropriate health education for participants? children
        (should first and foremost be delivered by parents); (2) participants? paternal
        health-related guidance approach (reactive, rather than proactive); (3) participants?
        perceived influences on health-related communication with their children (gender
        roles, efficacy constraints); and (4) paternal definitions of health (most
        often associated with diet).&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusion: Understanding AAFs?
        perceived and desired role in their children?s health edification can inform
        initiatives that actively engage these men, and nurture their level of involvement,
        to promote positive health behaviors among their children; this is necessary
        to realize their potential to actively improve the health of their children,
        families, and communities.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The open access

        tropical forests contribute to climate variations. However, observational
        data are very limited in such regions. This study used passive microwave remote
        sensing data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special
        Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS), providing observations under all
        weather conditions, to investigate the LST over the Amazon and Congo rainforests.
        The SSM/I and SSMIS data were collected from 1996 to 2012. The morning and
        afternoon observations from passive microwave remote sensing facilitate the
        investigation of the interannual changes of LST anomalies on a diurnal basis.
        As a result of the variability of cloud cover and the corresponding reduction
        of solar radiation, the afternoon LST anomalies tend to vary more than the
        morning LST anomalies. The dominant spatial and temporal patterns for interseasonal
        variations of the LST anomalies over the tropical rainforest were analyzed.
        The impacts of droughts and El Ni?os on this LST were also investigated. Differences
        between early morning and late afternoon LST anomalies were identified by
        the remote sensing product, with the morning LST anomalies controlled by humidity
        (according to comparisons with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction

        causality</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Since 1984, when the hypothesis that
        HIV-causes-AIDS was announced, many scholars have questioned the premise and
        offered alternative explanations. Thirty years later, competing propositions
        as well as questioning of the mainstream hypothesis persist, often supported
        by prominent scientists. This article synthesizes the most salient questions
        raised, alongside theories proposing non-viral causes for AIDS. The synthesis
        is organized according to four categories of data believed to support the
        HIV-AIDS hypothesis: retroviral molecular markers; transmission electron microscopy
        (EM) images of retroviral particles; efficacy of anti-retroviral drugs; and
        epidemiological data. Despite three decades of concerted investments in the
        mainstream hypothesis, the lingering questions and challenges synthesized
        herein offer public health professionals an opportunity to reflect on their
        assumptions and practices regarding HIV/AIDS.&#xd;\n&#xd;\n?The HIV/AIDS hypothesis
        is one hell of a mistake?, wrote Kary Mullis in 1996 [(1), p. 14]. Mullis
        ? Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, 1993 ? and other distinguished scientists have
        claimed the HIV-causes-AIDS hypothesis is false, unproductive, and unethical.
        They have done so since 1984, when the hypothesis was proposed. Thirty years
        after countless studies, resources, and attempts to cure have been poured
        into the HIV-AIDS hypothesis, it may be fruitful to ask: What happened to
        those views and voices that once disagreed? Have the past three decades, with
        their scientific, technological, and public health developments, been sufficient
        to convince critics of the hypothesis? value? Have these advances been able
        to silence the questioning?&#xd;\n&#xd;\nHere, I synthesize the main criticisms
        aimed at the HIV-AIDS hypothesis, alongside select unorthodox1 theories proposing
        non-viral cause(s) for AIDS, to argue: far from being condemned to extinction,
        competing explanations for, and thorough questioning of the mainstream premise
        persist. Perhaps better known by the lay public than by health professionals,
        many explanations are, in fact, attracting a growing number of sympathizers.
        To support the argument, I employ historical research and data synthesis methods.
        I utilize, as data, trade and professional publications in tandem with authoritative
        scientific sources.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nIt is important to note that my purpose is
        not to review the state of the science regarding HIV/AIDS, nor to persuade
        readers to reject the mainstream hypothesis. Instead, I aim to expose readers
        to the persisting controversies, and to motivate them to raise questions of
        their own. Ultimately, then, this article invites the public health workforce
        to reflect on prevailing assumptions and practices regarding HIV-AIDS. Reflecting
        on assumptions and practices represents a central task for public health professionals;
        a vital step to ensure their (our) practice continually grounds itself in
        the most rigorous ethical standards (3).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-17T16:44:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-17T16:44:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-09-23</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>Goodson

        of Hydrophobic Surface Treatments on Dropwise Condensation and Freezing of
        Water</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Bryant, John</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The
        effects of hydrophobic coatings on the dropwise condensation process for a
        flat horizontal copper plate held at a temperature much lower than the surrounding
        air&#xd;\nwas investigated. Extensive qualitative and quantitative data were
        taken to describe these&#xd;\n&#xd;\neffects in terms of dropsize distributions,
        heat and mass transfer coefficients, and digital imaging of the microscopic
        condensing droplets in terms of various extensive properties.&#xd;\nConditions
        of the tests were laminar flow (Reynolds numbers of 600 to 1600), condensing
        surface temperature of -10.0?C, air temperatures of 1.5 to 7.5?C, and relative
        humidities of 50 to 90%. Digital imaging of the condensation process was done
        using a medium power microscope coupled to a solid-state camera and a computer-based
        image capture system. Three different treatments were used on the polished
        copper condensing surface; no coating, a silicone conformal coating, and a
        long-chain sulfur based coating. Results for the heat transfer data showed
        an increase of approximately 33% for condensation over a dry surface for the
        conditions of the study. The mechanism of condensation appeared consistently
        to be dropwise. A method to predict the Nusselt number, nucleation time, mean
        cluster size and the droplet surface density in terms of extensive properties
        that are known a priori was also developed based on the experimental data.&#xd;\n
        &#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\nA condensation model was developed based
        on heat transfer relationships for the condensation process and the psychometric
        qualities of the ambient air. The inputs to&#xd;\nthe model were the surface
        temperature of the condensing system, the contact angle of the liquid phase
        in contact with the surface, the moisture content and temperature of the air
        stream, and the velocity of the air flowing over the condensing surface. Comparisons
        were made between the experimental results and those predicted by the model
        for&#xd;\ndropsize distributions and mass of condensate on the surface. The
        results from the mode!&#xd;\n&#xd;\nwere within ?25% of the experimental values.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nIt
        was found that the application of a hydrophobic coating on a surface that
        is to be operated at a temperature below the freezing point of water will
        delay the onset of ice nucleation by 15 to 35% over an uncoated surface.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T18:13:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T18:13:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995-12</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/154822</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>ESL-TH-95-12-03;</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>Texas

        Yian</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The present work is concerned with developing
        a discretized analytical model to investigate the effect of a backfill on
        the performance of a vertical U-tube ground-coupled heat pump.    This  work
        \  involves  the  development  of  an  analytical  solution   and  an expression
        \  for   the  equivalent   diameter,   and   the  experimental   verification
        \  of   their applications in the system model.&#xd;\nThe   approximate   analytical
        \  solution   was   developed   to   the   transient   heat? conduction problem
        in an infinite composite medium composed of a backfill and the soil with an
        internal cylindrical heat source.    This was intended to improve the prediction
        of the performance of a U-tube ground   heat exchanger.     The generalized
        \  orthogonal expansion technique was utilized in deriving this solution.
        \  Solutions  are  presented  in a wide range of the Fourier number for the
        non-dimensional temperature as a function of the ratios of thermal conductivities
        and diffusivities of the backfill and soil  Sensitivities of the  results
        \ to  assumptions  about  the  sizes  of  the  backfilling region  and  the
        \ far-field boundary  were also  examined.    To verify the correctness of
        the solution, comparisons were made between this solution, and the classical
        homogeneous cylindrical solution and a finite difference solution..&#xd;\nTo
        improve the equivalent diameter approach to the thermal interference problem
        between the legs of the U-tube, a general expression for the equivalent diameter
        was derived under steady state.   The transient analytical solution, developed
        earlier combined with the superposition method and the conformal mapping technique
        were used to justify this expression.&#xd;\nA small-scale U-tube test facility
        was constructed for the experimental validation of the system model of the
        U-tube heat exchanger using the analytical solution and the equivalent diameter
        expression.   Two types of backfill materials: bentonite/masonry sand and
        bentonite/copper powder were chosen for the tests.&#xd;\nFinally, the parametric
        studies were conducted to characterize the effects of the thermal properties
        of the backfill, the leg spacing as well as the size of the backfill region.
        A backfill effectiveness was proposed and discussed.  These studies provide
        a number of insights into the heat transfer behavior of  the U-tube  heat
        exchanger  buried  in a non? homogeneous medium.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T18:36:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T18:36:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/154823</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>ESL-TH-95-08-04;</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>Texas

        of Fourier Series and Artificial Neural Network Approaches to Model Hourly
        Energy Use in Commercial Buildings</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Dhar, Amitava</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>This
        dissertation develops Fourier series and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches
        to model hourly energy use in commercial buildings and illustrates application
        to data-screening.&#xd;\nThe procedure for modeling hourly energy use has
        two steps: (i) Day-typing and (ii) Model development.  The mean diurnal energy
        \ use and the diurnal profile may be different during working weekdays, weekends,
        holidays and Christmas due to major changes in mode of operation.  The first
        step, known as day-typing, is important for removing such effects.  The second
        step is to develop models for each day-type.&#xd;\nFourier series analysis
        is eminently suitable for modeling strongly periodic data. Energy use in commercial
        buildings being strongly periodic, is appropriate for Fourier series treatment.
        \ Generalized Fourier Series (GFS) model equations, developed for both weather
        independent and weather dependent energy use, give a set of parameters involving
        time and/or weather variables. Stepwise regression is performed to select
        the important parameters and a final model for each day-type is developed
        using the selected parameters.&#xd;\nThere are situations when only temperature
        data is available. A Temperature based Fourier Series (TFS) equation for modeling
        heating and cooling energy use has been developed to deal with such cases.
        Two important advantages of TFS are that it (i)&#xd;\n &#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\nrepresents
        nonlinear variation of energy use in a linearized functional form and (ii)
        can indirectly account for humidity and solar effect in the cooling energy
        use.&#xd;\nANNs with back propagation algorithms give high prediction accuracy
        and has been applied by many researchers to model hourly energy use in commercial
        buildings. However, the training of Back  Propagation Network (BPN) algorithms
        is a long, uncertain process.  ANNs with local basis functions require significantly
        shorter training times than conventional BPNs. A methodology has been developed
        to model heating and cooling energy use in commercial buildings using a one-hidden-layer
        ANN with two dimensional wavelet basis functions derived from cubic splines.&#xd;\nA
        suitable prediction interval can be generated and used to perform data? screening.
        \ Application of the TFS approach to data-screening is illustrated with monitored
        data.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T18:40:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T18:40:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/154825</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>ESL-TH-95-05-03;</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>Texas

        losses   in the transition fittings were  found  to be a function of three
        \ parameters; namely, Stokes number, area  ratio,  and  half-angle.  Based
        \ on  experimental data,  correlations were  developed that allow prediction
        of  particle  losses  in contraction and  expansion    fittings as a function
        \ of Stokes  number, area   ratio,  and  half-angle.   A  correlation  was

        fittings was also modelled numerically and  the  numerical  results  show
        \ good  agreement with  experimental&#xd;\ndata.   In general, losses in a

        &#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\nLosses in expansion  fittings  increase
        \ with  decreasing  half-angle  down  to an angle of  approximately   12 degrees
        thereafter,  losses  decrease   with  decreasing  half-angle.          Losses
        decrease with decreasing area ratio.  A 90 degree expansion half-angle fitting
        produced the lowest aerosol  losses.&#xd;\nThe  correlation   for  large-diameter

        \ for  deposition  in small  diameter  tubes  as well  for the full  range
        of tube sizes (13 mm to 102 mm diameter)  and Reynolds  numbers  (up to 55,000)
        tested.  For large tubes, the correlation  shows improved prediction characteristics
        as compared to earlier models.  For example, penetration  of 20 um aerodynamic
        diameter aerosol particles through a  I 02  mm diameter  tube  at  a flow
        \ rate of 2260  L/min was  measured  to  be 59%.   The present model predicts
        a penetration  of 62%, while two previously  reported  models that do not
        \ include Reynolds number  effects,  predict 80%  and 82%.&#xd;\nThe correlations
        \ presented  in this study should  be useful  sub-models  for predicting aerosol
        losses in transition fittings  and large-diameter  transport  system; in general,

        Analysis of Grocery Store Energy Use</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Cox, Raplh Luther,
        III</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Approximately 3% of the United States' commercial
        building energy consumption is attributable to food sales facilities.  Although
        this is one of the smallest consumption percentages, it is still significant,
        amounting to about 151 trillion Btu, or $2.17 billion per year.  Food sales
        facilities ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 sq. ft. use 3 to 5.5 W/ sq. ft.
        (32 to 60 W/ sq. m.) &#xd;\nof electricity two to three times what&#xd;\n
        &#xd;\ntypical office buildings of the same size use (EIA 1986).  Identifying
        potentials for energy savings in food sales facilities is therefore a worth-while
        pursuit.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nWhy do people study energy consumption?  According to
        Haberl et al. (1990), there are five different groups of people who can benefit
        from building energy monitoring and at least seven basic applications of energy
        monitoring projects.  The five groups of beneficiaries are:  the energy analyst;
        the energy consumer; governmental agencies; engineers, manufacturers, and
        contractors; and, utility and fuel suppliers.  The seven basic applications
        are: energy consumption and load forecasting, evaluation of end-use energy
        data, the monitoring of energy savings from retrofits, determining system
        .efficiencies, environmental quality issues, analyzing the human factor, and
        diagnosing operational and maintenance problems.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThis thesis
        is a study of the energy use in supermarkets, which fall into the category
        of the energy consumer.  This study is of interest to the energy analyst and
        the manufacturers of grocery store equipment, and to utilities which can use
        the results of energy consumption modeling procedures developed herein as
        inputs to load-predicting models.  Many papers and reports have been written
        about the energy use in grocery stores.  In general, they addressed three
        major issues:  energy use surveys and market analyses, refrigeration and HVAC
        system improvements, and energy use modeling methods.  This thesis extends
        the foregoing work by first performing a general energy use survey of over
        90 grocery stores, and presenting statistics regarding their energy use characteristics.
        \ Then, several of the previous methods of energy consumption modeling are
        adapted and applied to the whole-&#xd;\n &#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\nbuilding and
        sub-metered component load data from two case study grocery stores. Two methods
        of modeling, multiple linear regression and principal component analysis are
        evaluated.  Finally, a new method is developed and tested that allows for
        the accurate estimation of sub-metered loads without incurring the expense
        of collecting many months of hourly, sub-metered data.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T18:51:21Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T18:51:21Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1993-12</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/154827</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>ESL-TH-93-12-01;</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>Texas

        Effects of Frost Growth on Finned Tube Heat Exchangers under Laminar Flow</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Kondepudi,
        Sekhar</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>A study on the effects of frost growth
        on the performance of finned tube heat exchangers under laminar flow has been
        conducted.  The study was both experimental and analytical.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe
        experimental part of the investigation dealt with different fin geometries:
        louvered,  corrugated,  wavy,  flat  plate  fins  and  also  spine  fin  types.\tThe
        parameters  which  were  varied  include  the  air  humidity,  air  and  refrigerant
        temperature, air flow rate and fin density. A new term called the energy transfer
        coefficient has been defined to account for the combined heat and mass transfer
        processes occurring during frosting. The variables measured were the amount
        of frost growth, the energy transfer coefficient, the pressure drop across
        the coils, the enthalpy drop, and the effectiveness of the coils.  The general
        trends were found to be consistent with the literature.  It was found that
        the frost growth increases with humidity, air temperature, velocity and fin
        density due to an increase in the mass transfer.  The dominant factor was
        the humidity content of the air.  When the relative humidity was increased
        from 74%  to 80 %  at an air temperature of&#xd;\n &#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\n&#xd;\n32
        degrees F, the frost growth increased by approximately 22 %.   The energy
        transfer coefficient initially increases by 10 to 15%  with the onset of frost
        formation due to increased surface area and surface roughness but then drops
        off due to the insulating layer of frost. The louvered fin type had the highest
        energy transfer coefficient in the neighborhood of 50 Btu/hr-F-sq. ft.  as
        compared to the flat fin type which was in the neighborhood of 38 Btu/hr-sq.
        ft. ?     However, when these results were normalized with respect to dry
        co.1ditions, it was found that the flat fin type performed better than the
        louvered fin type.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nA mathematical model was developed to  simulate
        the experiments, based on fundamental heat and mass transfer principles.  Due
        to the complexity of the problem, the model in its present form can  handle
        flat plate fin types only.   In addition to being able to predict energy transfer
        and frost growth, the model also performs a non-dimensional analysis on the
        heat exchanger performance in terms of NTU - Effectiveness, and Fin Performance.
        Comparisons were made between the experimental results and those predicted
        by the model for the frost growth, energy transfer coefficient, pressure drop
        and heat exchanger effectiveness. The results from the model were within 15
        to 20%  of the experimental values</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T19:02:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-18T19:02:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1988-12</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/154831</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>ESL-TH-88-12-02;</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>Texas

        conservation studies performed for the University of Colorado Student Recreation
        Center.&#xd;\nThe studies began late in 1980 when the University of Colorado
        Student Administrators asked Dr. John Dow to perform a solar feasibility study.
        \ Since such a feasibility study had previously been performed by Dr. Dow,
        as well as other studies (Numark and Bartlett, 1981), a comprehensive energy
        conservation project was recommended, funded, performed and delivered (Dow,&#xd;\n1981).&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe
        second phase of the study began in November 1983, when Dr. Judith Bryant asked
        that additional energy conservation studies be performed. The building has
        been under continuous study since.&#xd;\nThe\tthird phase of the study,\tbeginning
        in the\tsummer\tof&#xd;\n&#xd;\n1985,\trepresents the prelude to this work.
        It originally focused on providing monthly forecasts of energy consumption.
