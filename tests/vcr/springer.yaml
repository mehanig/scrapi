        page classification plays a major role in information management and retrieval
        task. Feature selection is an important process for accurate classification
        of Web pages. Web pages contain several features, and more number of features
        reduce the classification accuracy. We propose a hybrid feature selection
        approach which is both efficient and effective for automatic Web page classification
        problem and also helps the Web search tool to get relevant results in the
        relevant category. Experiments were conducted by us with various feature selection
        methods for Web page classification and keyword search problem. From these
        experiments, it was found that some features present in the initial feature
        set (IFS) are irrelevant, redundant, and noisy, and they consume more memory
        space, increase computational time, and give a poor predictive performance.
        These features can be eliminated using evaluator methods such as principal
        component analysis, consistency subset evaluator, and search methods such
        as genetic search and rank search, resulting in minimal and more relevant
        features. We call these features as intermediate feature set (IMFS), and further
        optimization in this feature set gives more accurate results. Finally, attribute-selected
        classifier which is a part of machine learning meta-classifier was applied
        to the IMFS to get final feature set (FFS), and it was found that accuracy
        has increased up to 97% and computational time for all classifiers is minimized
        compared to IFS using WebKb (Faculty and Course) and ODP (Sports) benchmarking
        datasets. The proposed method yields better classification performance and
        reduces space requirements and search time in the Web documents compared with
        the existing methods.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12282-015-0638-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12282-015-0638-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12282-015-0638-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12282-015-0638-3\"}],\"title\":\"Adult

        to breast cancer diagnosis while exploring the modifying effects of demographic
        variables.MethodsThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data
        were used. Women included were\_\u226550\_years, not pregnant and without
        a diagnosis of any cancer but breast. The total sample included 2895 women
        (172 with breast cancer and 2723 controls with no breast cancer diagnosis).
        Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the OR and 95\_% CIs
        and interaction evaluated by including an interaction term in the model.ResultsWomen
        whose BMI increased from normal or overweight to obese compared to those who
        remained at a normal BMI were found to have a 2 times higher odds (OR\_=\_2.1;
        95\_% CI 1.11\u20133.79) of developing breast cancer. No significant association

        series classification is related to many different domains, such as health
        informatics, finance, and bioinformatics. Due to its broad applications, researchers
        have developed many algorithms for this kind of tasks, e.g., multivariate
        time series classification. Among the classification algorithms, k -nearest
        neighbor ( k -NN) classification (particularly 1 -NN) combined with dynamic
        time warping (DTW) achieves the state of the art performance. The deficiency
        is that when the data set grows large, the time consumption of 1 -NN with
        DTWwill be very expensive. In contrast to 1 -NN with DTW, it is more efficient
        but less effective for feature-based classification methods since their performance
        usually depends on the quality of hand-crafted features. In this paper, we
        aim to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches through
        the feature learning techniques. Specifically, we propose a novel deep learning
        framework, multi-channels deep convolutional neural networks (MC-DCNN), for
        multivariate time series classification. This model first learns features
        from individual univariate time series in each channel, and combines information
        from all channels as feature representation at the final layer. Then, the
        learnt features are applied into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for classification.
        Finally, the extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our model
        is not only more efficient than the state of the art but also competitive
        in accuracy. This study implies that feature learning is worth to be investigated
        for the problem of time series classification.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10677-015-9634-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10677-015-9634-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10677-015-9634-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10677-015-9634-0\"}],\"title\":\"Nancy

        order to develop a durable highly hydrophobic surface, a biomimetic design
        was developed by combining an organic monolithic resin, TiO2 photocatalyst,
        and polytetrafluoroethylene particles. An accelerated weathering resistance
        examination revealed that the highly hydrophobic surface maintained a water
        contact angle exceeding 140\xB0 for 6\_years. Moreover, high antiwear performance
        was confirmed by a rubbing test. Since the organic monolithic resin had co-continual
        structures with interconnected pores, new surface with a microstructure appeared
        continually by removal of the damaged surface. On the other hand, decomposition
        of organic compounds by TiO2 photocatalyst enabled self-etching of the damaged
        top layer of the organic monolithic resin. The flowing water due to rainfall
        or physical scraping contributed to the removal of the damaged surface. However,
        the film thickness after surface restoration was approximately constant. In
        addition, dynamic hydrophobicity could be improved when interconnected pores
        of the organic monolithic resins were impregnated with perfluorocarbon liquid.

        substrate followed by T-I, A-I and C-I, respectively. Moreover, judging from
        the repair requirements and sensitivity to specific polymerase inhibitors,
        there were overlapping repair activities in processing of dI in DNA. Indeed,
        a hereditable non-polyposis colorectal cancer cell line (HCT116) demonstrated
        lower dI repair activity that was partially attributed to lack of mismatch
        repair.ConclusionsA plasmid-based convenient and non-radioisotopic method
        was created to study dI repair in human cells. Mutagenic dI lesions processed
        in vitro can be scored by restriction enzyme cleavage to evaluate the repair.
        The repair assay described in this study provides a good platform for further
        investigation of human repair pathways involved in dI processing and their
        biological significance in mutation prevention.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00101-015-0081-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00101-015-0081-z\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00101-015-0081-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00101-015-0081-z\"}],\"title\":\"Medizinprodukterecht

        Devices Law is a relatively new legal system, which has replaced the still
        well-known medical devices regulations in Germany. The Medical Devices Law
        in Germany is based on European directives, which have been translated into
        national law with the Medical Devices Act. The Medical Devices Act is a framework
        of regulations and incorporates a number of decrees that address specific
        topics within the medical devices directives and in turn individual regulations
        refer to guidelines and recommendations from other sources which provide detailed
        technical information on specific topics. Overall, the Medical Devices Act
        represents a very complex legal system, which needs to be permanently observed
        with respect to continuous updating and adjustment. In this article the design

        study of Leibniz bialgebras arising naturally through the double of Leibniz
        algebras analogue to the classical Drinfeld\u2019s double is presented. A
        key ingredient of our work is the fact that the underline vector space of
        a Leibniz algebra becomes a Lie algebra and also a commutative associative
        algebra, when provided with appropriate new products. A special class of them,
        the coboundary Leibniz bialgebras, gives us the natural framework for studying
        the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE) in our context, inspired in the classical Yang-Baxter
        equation as well as in the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Results of the
        existence of coboundary Leibniz bialgebra on a symmetric Leibniz algebra under
        certain conditions are obtained. Some interesting examples of coboundary Leibniz

        study aimed to clarify differences in prognostic factors, metastatic features,
        and recurrence rates between histologic types in patients with stage 4 colorectal
        cancer (CRC) who had undergone curative resection.MethodsThe data from 1131
        patients with stage 4 colorectal cancer from the databases of referral institutions
        were analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups according to histologic
        types as follows: patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, mucinous
        adenocarcinoma, or signet-ring cell carcinoma (Por/Muc/Sig) and patients with
        well-differentiated or moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (Wel/Mod).
        Differences in clinicopathologic features, relapse-free survival (RFS) rates,
        and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates between the groups were evaluated.ResultsAlthough
        RFS did not differ between the Por/Muc/Sig and Wel/Mod groups, CSS was significantly
        shorter in the Por/Muc/Sig group\u2019s than in the Wel/Mod group, and survival
        after recurrence was significantly worse in the Por/Muc/Sig group than in
        theWel/Mod group. The incidence of peritoneal or local recurrence was significantly
        higher for the Por/Muc/Sig patients, whereas the resection recurrence rate
        was 16.4\_%. Multivariate analysis suggested that histologic type was an independent
        prognostic factor for survival after recurrence.ConclusionsThe patients with
        Por/Muc/Sig CRC synchronous metastasis had significantly shorter survival
        times than the patients with other CRC histologies, even if the metastases
        were curatively resected.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10569-015-9648-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10569-015-9648-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10569-015-9648-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10569-015-9648-x\"}],\"title\":\"Erratum

        a nivel multilateral como regional, ha habido esfuerzos para abordar el d\xE9ficit
        democr\xE1tico en las negociaciones comerciales. Un ejemplo es el Acuerdo
        de Asociaci\xF3n Econ\xF3mica (Economic Partnership Agreement, \u201C\u201CPA\u201D\u201D
        entre la Uni\xF3n Europea y el grupo de pa\xEDses de \xC1frica, Caribe y Pac\xEDfico
        en el que la participaci\xF3n de la sociedad civil qued\xF3 consagrada en
        el acuerdo de Cotonou. Sin embargo, el EPA CARIFORUM-UE atrajo muchas cr\xEDticas
        de la sociedad civil. El presente documento argumenta que la sociedad civil
        fracas\xF3 a la hora de influir en los resultados del EPA porque participaron
        en el proceso dentro de un marco democr\xE1tico de deliberaci\xF3n que no
        permiti\xF3 la emancipaci\xF3n o un cuestionamiento del poder econ\xF3mico
        mundial y de las consideraciones estructurales en las negociaciones; ni obtuvo
        el empoderamiento ni la apropiaci\xF3n ciudadana. Abogamos por la pr\xE1ctica
        de la democracia participativa en la toma de decisiones de pol\xEDticas comerciales
        - un espacio ideal para la participaci\xF3n ciudadana - ya que ofrece mayores
        esperanzas de influir en la agenda de la pol\xEDtica comercial.ZusammenfassungSowohl
        auf den multilateralen als auch den regionalen Ebenen hat es Bem\xFChungen
        gegeben, um das demokratische Defizit bei Handelsgespr\xE4chen anzugehen.
        Ein Beispiel daf\xFCr ist das Wirtschaftspartnerschaftsabkommen (WPA) zwischen
        der Europ\xE4ischen Union und afrikanischen, karibischen und pazifischen L\xE4ndergruppen,
        in denen die b\xFCrgergesellschaftliche Partizipation im Cotonou-Abkommen
        verankert wurde. Doch erhielt das CARIFORUM-EU WPA viel Kritik seitens der
        B\xFCrgergesellschaft. In dem Beitrag wird argumentiert, dass die B\xFCrgergesellschaft
        keinen Einfluss auf das Resultat des WPA hatte, da in dem Prozess innerhalb
        eines beratenden demokratischen Rahmenwerks eine Emanzipation oder eine Herausforderung
        f\xFCr eine globale Wirtschaftsmacht sowie strukturelle Erw\xE4gungen in den
        Verhandlungen unm\xF6glich waren; auch wurde keine B\xFCrgereinbindung und
        -verantwortung erreicht. Wir bef\xFCrworten die Praxis partizipatorischer
        Demokratie bei handelspolitischen Entscheidungen - ein idealer Bereich f\xFCr
        B\xFCrgerpartizipation. Diese ist f\xFCr die Beeinflussung der handelspolitischen
        Agenda vielversprechender.R\xE9sum\xE9Aux niveaux multilat\xE9ral et r\xE9gional,
        des efforts ont \xE9t\xE9 faits pour combler le d\xE9ficit d\xE9mocratique
        dans les n\xE9gociations commerciales. On peut donner comme exemple l\u2019accord
        de partenariat \xE9conomique (APE) entre l\u2019Union europ\xE9enne et le
        groupe des \xC9tats d\u2019Afrique, des Cara\xEFbes et du Pacifique, o\xF9
        la participation de la soci\xE9t\xE9 civile a \xE9t\xE9 consacr\xE9e par l\u2019accord
        de Cotonou. Pourtant, l\u2019accord de partenariat \xE9conomique CARIFORUM-UE
        a attir\xE9 beaucoup de critiques de la soci\xE9t\xE9 civile. L\u2019article
        soutient que la soci\xE9t\xE9 civile n\u2019a pas r\xE9ussi \xE0 influer sur
        le r\xE9sultat de l\u2019APE parce qu\u2019elle avait particip\xE9 au processus
        dans un cadre de d\xE9mocratie d\xE9lib\xE9rative, qui ne permettait pas l\u2019\xE9mancipation
        ou une remise en cause de la puissance \xE9conomique mondiale et des consid\xE9rations
        structurales dans les n\xE9gociations, pas plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019a accompli
        l\u2019appropriation et le renforcement des pouvoirs des citoyens. Nous pr\xE9conisons

        both the multilateral and regional levels, there have been efforts to address
        the democratic deficit in trade negotiations. One such example is the Economic
        Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the European Union and African, Caribbean
        and Pacific group of countries where civil society participation was enshrined
        in the Cotonou Agreement. Yet, the CARIFORUM\u2013EU EPA attracted much criticism
        from civil society. The paper argues that civil society failed to affect the
        outcome of the EPA because they participated in the process within a deliberative
        democratic framework which did not allow for emancipation or a challenge to
        global economic power and structural considerations in the negotiations; neither
        did it achieve citizen empowerment and ownership. We advocate the practice
        of participatory democracy in trade policy decision making\u2014an ideal space
        for citizen participation\u2014the former holding greater promise for influencing
        the trade policy agenda.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12207-015-9227-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12207-015-9227-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12207-015-9227-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12207-015-9227-1\"}],\"title\":\"Application

        Meyers Neuropsychological Battery (MNB) is a neuropsychological assessment
        battery used to detect cognitive impairment caused by acquired brain injury.
        Results obtained by examinees given the MNB have been submitted as evidence
        in a judicial proceeding in cases involving traumatic brain injury (TBI) and
        other neurocognitive disorders. We provide an examination of the MNB when
        used with the Rohling Interpretive Method (RIM) through the lens of Daubert
        v. Merrell Dow ( 1993 ). Daubert established criteria to be applied by judges
        to determine who can provide expert opinions and what these experts are allowed
        to present to the triers of fact. Daubert has five criteria judges consider
        in their role as gatekeepers of an expert\u2019s testimony. These standards
        are utilized to ascertain if the expert\u2019s testimony is scientific, with
        particular focus on its reliability, validity, and relevancy. We report on
        the MNB-RIM\u2019s ability to withstand the rigors of a Daubert analysis,
        with each criterion addressed in sequence. To accomplish this task, we review
        the peer-reviewed literature that has tested each of the MNB components, as
        well as the utility of the battery in its entirety. The literature extends
        over the 20-year history that the MNB and the RIM have been in use in clinical
        and forensic assessments. Statistics regarding the MNB-RIM\u2019s error rate
        have been empirically derived in numerous publications. These factors have
        led to a \u201Cgeneral acceptance\u201D of the battery and the material. Our
        review is intended to provide users of the MNB-RIM with the information they
        will need to successfully defend against a Daubert challenge.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12310-015-9158-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12310-015-9158-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12310-015-9158-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12310-015-9158-8\"}],\"title\":\"Collaborating

        study expands on prior work investigating the transferability of parent\u2013child
        interaction therapy, an efficacious treatment program targeting parents of
        children with disruptive behavior problems, for use as a universal preventive
        intervention targeting classroom teachers. Using a case study design, Teacher\u2013Child
        Interaction Training (TCIT) was implemented sequentially with two groups of
        teachers ( N \_=\_20) and 169 preschool and kindergarten students in a public
        school setting. This study served as a pilot test for the feasibility of having
        local school staff independently implement TCIT, following training and participation
        in an initial delivery of TCIT conducted by a research team. Controlling for
        teacher effects, teacher ratings of children\u2019s total protective factor
        scores (TPF) significantly increased and ratings of behavior concerns (BC)
        significantly decreased over the course of the intervention. Boys and students
        qualifying for special education received lower TPF and higher BC ratings
        at baseline, yet interactions with time were nonsignificant, suggesting that
        all students improved according to teacher ratings across time. Observational
        data showed that teachers in both researcher-delivered and local staff-delivered
        groups substantially increased in their use of positive attention skills following
        training. Intervention effects, as well as program implementation factors
        (e.g., teacher attendance, homework completion), were comparable across researcher
        and school-based staff deliveries, suggesting that school staff were able
        to implement TCIT effectively. We discuss future research directions for TCIT
        implementation and development, as well as practical considerations for partnering

        anesthesiology. While anesthesiologists manage the greatest number of airways
        in their training and practice, a variety of medical providers perform airway
        management in the trauma population (i.e., paramedics, emergency physicians,
        anesthesiologists, respiratory therapists). Rates of successful intubation
        can vary widely between groups; therefore, a definition of expertise is required
        to develop training plans, as well as standards for maintenance of proficiency.
        While competency is challenging to define in any field, the data suggest that
        individuals with the greatest experience achieve the highest level of success.
        Given that anesthesiologists manage several thousand airway encounters throughout
        their training and careers, their leadership as subject matter experts is
        essential to development of training curricula in airway management of all
        varieties. Consensus on training of less experienced providers, as well as
        tasking of the most difficult cases to the most experienced provider, is imperative
        for successful airway management in trauma.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12024-015-9714-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12024-015-9714-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12024-015-9714-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12024-015-9714-4\"}],\"title\":\"Decapitation:

        objective of this retrospective study was to present the authors\u2019 experience
        on the management of labyrinthine fistula secondary to cholesteatoma. 695
        patients, who underwent tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma, in a University Hospital
        between 1993 and 2013 were reviewed, to select only those with labyrinthine
        fistulas. 42 patients (6%) had cholesteatoma complicated by fistula of the
        lateral semicircular canal (LSCC). The following data points were collected:
        symptoms, pre- and postoperative clinical signs, surgeon, CT scan diagnosis,
        fistula type, surgical technique, preoperative vestibular function and audiometric
        outcomes. Most frequent symptoms were unspecific, such as otorrhea, hearing
        loss and dizziness. However, preoperative high-resolution computed tomography
        predicted fistula in 88\_%. Using the Dornhoffer and Milewski classification,
        16 cases (38 %) were identified as stage 1, 22 (52 %) as stage II, and 4 (10
        %) as stage III. The choice between open or closed surgical procedure was
        independent of the type of fistulae. The cholesteatoma matrix was completely
        removed from the fistula and immediately covered by autogenous material. In
        eight patients (19 %), the canal was drilled with a diamond burr before sealing
        with autologous tissue. After surgery, hearing was preserved or improved in
        76 % of the patients. There was no statistically significant relationship
        between the extent of the labyrinthine fistula and the hearing outcome. In
        conclusion, a complete and nontraumatic removal of the matrix cholesteatoma
        over the fistula in a one-staged procedure and its sealing with bone dust
        and fascia temporalis, with sometimes exclusion of the LSCC, is a safe and

        inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic immune-mediated inflammatory
        diseases of the gut that occur in genetically predisposed individuals exposed
        to environmental triggers. Several immunosuppressive agents have been successfully
        used for induction and maintenance treatment in inflammatory bowel disease.
        These include steroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, anti-tumor necrosis factor
        (anti-TNF) alpha agents, anti-alpha 4 integrins, and anti-IL-12/23 agent to
        name a few. There are also limited data on novel approaches including thalidomide
        and stem cell transplant. In spite of the significant successes associated
        with these agents, numerous malignancies have been associated with their use.
        Lymphomas including hepatosplenic T cell lymphomas, non-melanoma skin cancers
        and, more recently, melanoma have been described, specifically with anti-TNF.MethodsWe
        reviewed the available published literature on melanoma in IBD, melanoma associated
        with anti-TNF, and the data on other treatment options in patients with IBD.
        In addition, we also reviewed the limited data on the gut specific integrin-vedolizumab.
        This may provide an additional option in the management of the subset of patients
        with IBD and melanoma.ResultsOptions for treatment of IBD should be based
        on the stage of melanoma, control of IBD, and patient preferences. It should
        involve shared decision-making and close interdisciplinary follow-up between
        the IBD physician and the dermatologist, preferably with expertise in the
        management of melanoma.ConclusionsTreatment choices in patients with IBD and
        melanoma are challenging. There is very limited data providing guidance in
        this subset of patients. As such, treatment and follow-up should be individualized,
        extensively discussed with patients and their families as appropriate, and
        done in conjunction with a close follow-up by gastroenterologist and dermatologist.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3116-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3116-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3116-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11661-015-3116-9\"}],\"title\":\"Microstructure

        (DP/IF). Material intermixing between the overlapping sheets takes place within
        the stirred zone. The truncated sheet interface curls upward into the top
        sheet, more so in case of IF/DP, due to lower resistance offered by the top
        (IF) sheet to the upward migrating bottom (DP) sheet material. Material from

        acicular ferrite and lath martensite. Under quasi-static loading, the crack
        passes along the dissimilar interface and into the top sheet thickness, resulting

        the initiation of kinked fatigue cracks and their subsequent propagation through
        the top and bottom sheet thickness. The dominant fatigue crack moves through

        For two of the questions, participants who drew graphs on the free-response

        incontinence (PPI) is one of the most bothersome complications of radical
        prostatectomy. A postoperative image survey may better predict PPI than a
        preoperative survey.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to determine whether
        postoperative cystography bladder patterns can predict PPI at short- and long-term
        follow-up.MethodsIn total, 180 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical
        prostatectomy (RARP) from September 2008 to September 2014, and who were followed
        for at least 6\_months, were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent
        cystography within 2\_weeks after RARP before Foley catheter removal, and
        all parameters were analyzed to evaluate the relationship with PPI at 1, 6,
        12, and 24\_months post-RARP. Patients were also divided into four bladder
        neck level groups, according to the relative position of the bladder neck
        to the pubic symphysis.ResultsA total of 119 patients were followed for at
        least 48\_months after RARP. Cystography patterns were analyzed, including
        the downward bladder neck, bladder height, bladder width, height to width
        ratio, and bladder neck angle. A more downward bladder neck and a sharper
        bladder neck angle were significant predictors of PPI at 1, 6, 12, and 24\_months
        after RARP. Patients with a larger bladder height or height to width ratio
        (prolate bladder shape) tended to have poor outcomes regarding PPI. Clinicians
        can also use a bladder neck level classification to rapidly predict the outcome
        of PPI.ConclusionsPostoperative cystography is a reliable and cost-effective
        tool for predicting PPI. A more downward bladder neck and a sharper bladder
        neck angle have the greatest predictive power for short- and long-term PPI.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00062-015-0464-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00062-015-0464-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00062-015-0464-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00062-015-0464-1\"}],\"title\":\"Pharmacokinetic

        (IA) administration of nimodipine has been shown to be an effective treatment
        for subarachnoid hemorrhage-related cerebral vasospasm. The concentrations
        achieved in cerebral arteries during this procedure, though, are unknown.
        Therefore, there are no clinical studies investigating dose-dependent effects
        of nimodipine. We aimed at providing a pharmacokinetic model for IA nimodipine
        therapy for this purpose.MethodsA two-compartment pharmacokinetic model for
        intravenous nimodipine therapy was modified and used to assess cerebral arterial
        nimodipine concentration during IA nimodipine infusion into the internal carotid
        artery (ICA).ResultsAccording to our simulations, continuous IA nimodipine
        infusion at 2\_mg/h and 1\_mg/h resulted in steady-state cerebral arterial
        concentrations of about 200\_ng/ml and 100\_ng/ml assuming an ICA blood flow
        of 200\_ml/min and a clearance of 70\_l/h. About 85\u2009% of the maximal
        concentration is achieved within the first minute of IA infusion independent
        on the infusion dose. Within the range of physiological and pharmacokinetic
        data available in the literature, ICA blood flow has more impact on cerebral
        arterial concentration than nimodipine clearance.ConclusionThe presented pharmacokinetic
        model is suitable for estimations of cerebral arterial nimodipine concentration
        during IA infusion. It may, for instance, assist in dose-dependent analyses

        high-quality repair on aging hydro power equipment is a challenging issue
        for utilities. Weld repair deteriorates the mechanical properties of the base
        metal in and around the heat-affected zone. For martensitic stainless steel
        runners, there is no way to perform post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) on site
        to restore those properties without dismantling, a very expensive job for
        such large components, typical of power utilities. To perform in situ high-quality
        repairs on such components, a new robotic heat treatment process is developed.
        Heat is generated and controlled using a flat spiral coil mounted on a compact,
        portable robot and moved over the area needing heat treatment. Unlike conventional
        induction heating, which requires a customized coil, this new approach combines
        a universal coil and a flexible robot to heat a broad range of complex shapes.
        One critical aspect is to set heating and path parameters in order to generate
        a target spatial and temporal temperature field. This paper proposes a numerical
        method combining thermal finite element analysis and a non-linear optimization
        algorithm to set these parameters. The temperature resulting from the electromagnetic
        field induced by the coil is modeled using an average heat input source to
        improve computation speed. Good agreement is obtained between numerical and
        experimental results for PWHT under laboratory conditions.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10228-015-0488-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10228-015-0488-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10228-015-0488-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-015-0488-1\"}],\"title\":\"Turnover

        fish species generally migrate among habitats because of ontogenetic changes
        in their resource requirements; therefore, clarifying linkages among habitats
        throughout their life cycle is important for the management and conservation
        of their populations. Although carbon (\u03B4^13C) and nitrogen (\u03B4^15N)
        stable isotope ratios are widely used for elucidating fish migrations, information
        is still scarce how each fish species, including marbled flounder ( Pleuronectes
        yokohamae ), change the isotopic composition in their body tissues after they
        switch to a different diet during migrations. This study clarified isotopic
        turnover rates of marbled flounder during the juvenile stage using a diet-switch
        experiment in an aquarium. Furthermore, we statistically compared bulk samples
        (i.e., whole body without head and viscera) to partial muscle tissue samples
        to estimate the difference in the turnover rate as an index for diet switches.
        An exponential model was used to describe the temporal changes in \u03B4^13C
        and \u03B4^15N isotopic rates of juvenile marbled flounder. No significant
        difference was noted between the exponential models for changes in both \u03B4^13C

        messageThe glyphosate resistance in Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis was due

        crops have a high percentage in the total area devoted to transgenic crops
        worldwide. d -amino acid oxidase (DAAO) can metabolize glyphosate by oxidative
        cleavage of the carbon\u2013nitrogen bond on the carboxyl side and yield aminomethyl
        phosphonic acid and glyoxylate, which are less toxic to plants than glyphosate.
        To date, reports on the use of DAAO to enhance glyphosate resistance in plants
        are lacking. In this paper, we report synthesis, and codon usage optimization
        for plant expression, of the DAAO gene by successive polymerase chain reaction
        from Bradyrhizobium japonicum. To confirm the glyphosate resistance of the

        Markenst\xE4rke im gemeinn\xFCtzigen Bereich wird begrifflich erfasst als
        das Ma\xDF, in dem eine gemeinn\xFCtzige Marke bei einer Zielgruppe bekannt
        ist, positiv von einer Zielgruppe wahrgenommen wird und von einer Zielgruppe
        als bemerkenswert erachtet wird. Daher konzeptualisieren die Autoren die Markenst\xE4rke
        im gemeinn\xFCtzigen Sektor grunds\xE4tzlich als einen Bereich mit drei Dimensionen:
        Vertrautheit, Besonderheit und Einstellung. Die Autoren berichten \xFCber
        die Entwicklung einer Skala zur Markenst\xE4rke im gemeinn\xFCtzigen Bereich
        unter Hinzuziehung einer Reihe von gemeinn\xFCtzigen Marken in drei separaten
        Studien als Beweis f\xFCr die Zuverl\xE4ssigkeit und G\xFCltigkeit der Skala.
        Es wird demonstriert, dass die Skala zwischen Wohlt\xE4tigkeitsorganisationen
        beruhend auf ihren jeweiligen Markenst\xE4rken unterscheiden kann. Dar\xFCber
        hinaus wird dargelegt, dass die Markenst\xE4rke im gemeinn\xFCtzigen Bereich
        den affektiven Dispositionen und Verhaltensabsichten einer Zielgruppe gegen\xFCber
        der gemeinn\xFCtzigen Marke vorhergeht.\u6458\u8981\u975E\u76C8\u5229\u54C1\u724C\u7684\u4F18\u52BF\u662F\u6307\u975E\u76C8\u5229\u6027\u54C1\u724C\u5728\u76EE\u6807\u7FA4\u4F53\u7684\u77E5\u540D\u5EA6\u3001\u559C\u7231\u7A0B\u5EA6\u548C\u88AB\u8BA4\u4E3A\u4F18\u79C0\u7684\u7A0B\u5EA6,\u56E0\u6B64,\u4F5C\u8005\u8BA4\u4E3A\u975E\u76C8\u5229\u54C1\u724C\u7684\u4F18\u52BF\u662F\u4E00\u4E2A\u5148\u9A8C\u6027\u7684\u4E09\u7EF4\u6982\u5FF5:

        in vitro permeation and in vivo drug distribution experiments. As a result,
        the optimal formulation was defined as 1.2% of EA, 1.48% of 4-MSK, 14.05%
        of Schercemol\u2122 DISM Ester (DISM) as the oil, 4.0% of Emulium\xAE Delta

        with the COW cream, the LLC cream significantly increased the skin retention
        of EA and 4-MSK both in vitro and in vivo . In conclusion, the LLC carrier
        serves as a promising choice for topical preparation by enhancing skin retention
        and providing desirable rheological characteristics.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s13148-015-0127-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s13148-015-0127-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13148-015-0127-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13148-015-0127-8\"}],\"title\":\"Musical

        imaging has been used for pigment characterization on paintings for the last

        hyperspectral camera, ranging from 400 to 1000\_nm in 80\u2013160 spectral
        bands. In order to treat the large amount of data that this imaging technique
        generates, one can use statistical tools such as principal component analysis

        PCA, convex geometry algorithms and the comparison of resulting clusters to
        database spectra with a specific tolerance (like the Spectral Angle Mapper

        to contain the epileptogenic zone and corresponds anatomically to the area
        localizing epileptogenicity in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
        The question is whether the volume of the perifocal pre-operative PET abnormalities,
        the extent of their resection, and the volume of the non-resected abnormalities
        affects the post-operative seizure outcome.MethodsThe sample group consisted
        of 32 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis who underwent anteromedial temporal
        lobe resection for refractory TLE. All patients had pathologic perifocal findings
        on both of the PET modalities as well as on the whole-brain MRI. The volumetric
        data of the PET and MRI abnormalities within the resected temporal lobe were
        estimated by automated quantitative voxel-based analysis. The obtained volumetric
        data were investigated in relation to the outcome subgroups of patients (Engel

        reefs within the Coral Triangle (CT) are home to the greatest marine diversity
        on the globe and are an important supplier of marine resources to densely
        populated coastal regions. Many coral reefs within the CT and around the world
        are under threat from over-exploitation. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have
        been proven to be effective tools in restoring fish stocks. However, the role
        that MPAs play in promoting connectivity at greater distances through larval
        dispersal is still unknown. RADseq was used to discover 4253 SNPs from 81
        individuals of the dusky parrotfish ( Scarus niger ) collected from three
        sites within the Philippines. A lack of population structure suggested a high
        rate of gene flow ( F _ST\_=\_0.007). Estimates of N_e from linkage disequilibrium
        are relatively large, ranging from 1200 to 2000. A sibling analysis revealed
        one pair of well-supported full siblings ( r \_=\_0.773) and one pair of putative
        half siblings ( r \_=\_0.191) between sites separated by more than 500\_km.
        The low F _ST values indicate a high degree of gene flow between the reefs
        within the sampling area while the sibling analysis suggests demographic connectivity
        between the Sibuyan Sea and the Sulu Sea. The Mindoro\u2013Panay throughflow
        is a likely vector by which larvae are transported between these sites, suggesting
        that reefs in Romblon are sources for reefs near Basay, 400\_km to the south.
        Given the reliance of a vast majority of coral reef fishes on larval dispersal,
        this study reveals that MPAs established within the central Philippines can
        supply varying levels of larvae to overfished reefs.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00170-015-7769-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-015-7769-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-015-7769-8\"}],\"title\":\"High

        this paper I examine the question of logic\u2019s normative status in the
        light of Carnap\u2019s Principle of Tolerance. I begin by contrasting Carnap\u2019s
        conception of the normativity of logic with that of his teacher, Frege. I
        identify two core features of Frege\u2019s position: first, the normative
        force of the logical laws is grounded in their descriptive adequacy; second,
        norms implied by logic are constitutive for thinking as such (in a sense to
        be clarified). While Carnap breaks with Frege\u2019s absolutism about logic
        and hence with the notion that any system of logic should have a privileged
        claim to correctness, I argue that there is a sense in which Carnap\u2019s
        framework-relative conception of logical norms has a constitutive role to
        play: though they are not constitutive for the conceptual activity for thinking,
        they do nevertheless set the ground rules that make certain forms of scientific
        inquiry possible in the first place. I\_conclude that Carnap\u2019s principle
        of tolerance is tamer than one might have thought and that, despite remaining
        differences, Frege\u2019s and Carnap\u2019s conceptions of logic have more
        in common than one might have thought.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11104-015-2658-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11104-015-2658-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11104-015-2658-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-015-2658-3\"}],\"title\":\"Biochars

        match attendance is an example of group behavior with noisy context that can
        only be approximated by a limited set of quantifiable factors. However, match
        attendance is representative of a wider spectrum of context-based behaviors
        for which only the aggregate effect of otherwise individual decisions is observable.
        Modeling of such behaviors is desirable from the perspective of economics,
        psychology, and other social studies with prospective use in simulators, games,
        product planning, and advertising. In this paper, we evaluate the efficiency
        of different neural network architectures as models of context in attendance
        behavior by comparing the achieved prediction accuracy of a multilayer perceptron
        (MLP), an Elman recurrent neural network (RNN), a time-lagged feedforward
        neural network (TLFN), and a radial basis function network (RBFN) against
        a multiple linear regression model, an autoregressive moving average model
        with exogenous inputs, and a naive cumulative mean model. We show that the
        MLP, TLFN, and RNN are superior to the RBFN and achieve comparable prediction
        accuracy on datasets of three teams from the English Football League Championship,
        which indicates weak importance of context transition modeled by the TLFN
        and the RNN. The experiments demonstrate that all neural network models outperform
        linear predictors by a significant margin. We show that neural models built
        on individual datasets achieve better performance than a generalized neural
        model constructed from pooled data. We analyze the input parameter influences
        extracted from trained networks and show that there is an agreement between

        E and 15\xB0 S\u201345\xB0 N at 30-km horizontal resolution with 23 vertical
        levels. Six 10-year (1991\u20132000) simulations are conducted with the combinations
        of two land surface schemes (BATS, CLM3.5) and three cumulus convection schemes
        (Kuo, Grell, MIT). The simulated annual and seasonal climatology of surface
        temperature and precipitation are compared with CRU observations. The interannual
        variability of these two parameters is also analyzed. The results indicate
        that the model simulated climatology is sensitive to the convection as well
        as land surface parameterization. The analysis of surface temperature (precipitation)
        climatology indicates that the model with CLM produces warmer (dryer) climatology,
        particularly over India. The warmer (dryer) climatology is due to the higher
        sensible heat flux (lower evapotranspiration) in CLM. The model with MIT convection
        scheme simulated wetter and warmer climatology (higher precipitation and temperature)
        with smaller Bowen ratio over southern India compared to that with the Grell
        and Kuo schemes. This indicates that a land surface scheme produces warmer
        but drier climatology with sensible heating contributing to warming where
        as a convection scheme warmer but wetter climatology with latent heat contributing
        to warming. The climatology of surface temperature over India is better simulated
        by the model with BATS land surface model in combination with MIT convection
        scheme while the precipitation climatology is better simulated with BATS land

        for monocots).ResultsIn this study, we identified 10, 6, 13 and 28 WRKY III
        genes in the genomes of Populus trichocarpa , grape ( Vitis vinifera ), Arabidopsis
        thaliana and rice ( Oryza sativa ), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
        that the WRKY III proteins could be divided into four clades. By microsynteny
        analysis, we found that the duplicated regions were more conserved between
        poplar and grape than Arabidopsis or rice. We dated their duplications by
        Ks analysis of Populus WRKY III genes and demonstrated that all the blocks
        were formed after the divergence of monocots and dicots. Strong purifying
        selection has played a key role in the maintenance of WRKY III genes in Populus
        . Tissue expression analysis of the WRKY III genes in Populus revealed that
        five were most highly expressed in the xylem. We also performed quantitative
        real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis of WRKY III genes in Populus
        treated with salicylic acid, abscisic acid and polyethylene glycol to explore
        their stress-related expression patterns.ConclusionsThis study highlighted
        the duplication and diversification of the WRKY III gene family in Populus
        and provided a comprehensive analysis of this gene family in the Populus genome.
        Our results indicated that the majority of WRKY III genes of Populus was expanded
        by large-scale gene duplication. The expression pattern of PtrWRKYIII gene
        identified that these genes play important roles in the xylem during poplar
        growth and development, and may play crucial role in defense to drought stress.
        Our results presented here may aid in the selection of appropriate candidate
        genes for further characterization of their biological functions in poplar.ReviewersThis

        a wide number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the function of these
        PRRs, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), in HIV-1 infection remains unclear.
        TLRs play an important role in innate immunity, and while their involvement
        in viral immune pathogenesis was recently proposed, little is known about
        their expression and function during the neutrophil response to HIV-1 exposure.
        Here, we have shown that freshly isolated human neutrophils from healthy donors
        exhibited altered TLR expression, which may affect their function, after being
        challenged with HIV-1, alone or in the presence of TLR agonists. TLRs may
        promote neutrophil activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, and the
        production of reactive oxygen species. To our knowledge, this study is the
        first demonstration of functional TLR expression on neutrophils in response
        to HIV-1 treatment, suggesting a possible neutrophil/HIV-1 interaction through
        TLRs. Although additional studies are required to confirm the function of
        TLRs in neutrophils, our data clearly suggest that they play a role in the

        has traditionally focused on ruin-related quantities. In particular, the so-called
        expected discounted penalty function (Gerber and Shiu. N Am Actuar J, 2(1):48\u201378,
        1998 ) has been the object of a thorough study over the years. Although interesting
        in their own right, ruin related quantities do not seem to capture path-dependent
        properties of the reserve. In this article we aim at presenting the probabilistic
        properties of drawdowns and the speed at which an insurance reserve depletes
        as a consequence of the risk exposure of the company. These new quantities
        are not ruin related yet they capture important features of an insurance position
        and we believe it can lead to the design of a meaningful risk measures. Studying
        drawdowns and speed of depletion for L\xE9vy insurance risk processes represent
        a novel and challenging concept in insurance mathematics. In this paper, all
        these concepts are formally introduced in an insurance setting. Moreover,
        we specialize recent results in fluctuation theory for L\xE9vy processes (Mijatovic
        and Pistorius. Stoch Process Their Appl, 22:3812\u20133836, 2012 ) in order
        to derive expressions for the distribution of several quantities related to
        the depletion problem. Of particular interest are the distribution of drawdowns
        and the Laplace transform for the speed of depletion. These expressions are
        given for several examples of L\xE9vy insurance risk processes for which they

        study aims to establish a common Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) framework
        for reporting about the gypsum industry biodiversity at the European level.
        In order to integrate different opinions and to reach a consensus framework,
        an original participatory process approach has been developed among different
        stakeholder groups: Eurogypsum, European and regional authorities, university
        scientists, consulting offices, European and regional associations for the
        conservation of nature, and the extractive industry. The strategy is developed
        around four main steps: (1) building of a maximum set of indicators to be
        submitted to stakeholders based on the literature (Focus Group method); (2)
        evaluating the consensus about indicators through a policy Delphi survey aiming
        at the prioritization of indicator classes using the Analytic Hierarchy Process
        method (AHP) and of individual indicators; (3) testing acceptability and feasibility
        through analysis of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and visits to
        three European quarries; (4) Eurogypsum final decision and communication.
        The resulting framework contains a set of 11 indicators considered the most
        suitable for all the stakeholders. Our KPIs respond to European legislation
        and strategies for biodiversity. The framework aims at improving sustainability
        in quarries and at helping to manage biodiversity as well as to allow the
        creation of coherent reporting systems. The final goal is to allow for the

        Matiushkina and Kharitonova.\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractBackgroundThe
        study of clay fractions is usually focused on water-dispersible clay (WDC),
        which is a good indicator of many soil processes involving water (water erosion,
        transfer and removal of nutrients and contaminants). Aggregated clay (AC)
        that remains after WDC extraction is also important, as it controls the formation
        of aggregates and their mechanical and water resistance. The aim of this study
        was a gradual extraction of WDC and AC fractions from periodically overmoistening
        meadow podbel (mollic planosol) and the study of the content and composition
        of humic substances and clay minerals in these fractions as well as their
        effect on the hydrosorption capacity.ResultsThe complete extraction of clay
        fractions showed that AC prevails over WDC along the entire profile and most
        evidently in the Ag horizon. Most of the organic matter is concentrated in
        AC. X-ray diffractometry and SEM analysis revealed a similar set of minerals
        in both fractions, but in different proportions. In the Ag and Elcg horizons,
        WDC is enriched with clastic components (fine-dispersed quartz, feldspars,
        amphiboles) and clay minerals with rigid structures (illite, kaolinite, chlorite),
        compared to AC. In the Btg1 horizon smectite prevails in both fractions. The
        specific surface, which characterizes the hydrosorption capacity of clays,
        of WDC is 28\u201395\_m^2/g less than that of AC. Maximal difference in specific
        surface of clays is found in the horizon Elcg, where AC has the highest content
        of free iron.ConclusionsThe present study allowed defining the heterogeneity
        of the total clay in the periodically overmoistened meadow soil, which is
        manifested in differences in composition and properties of WDC and AC fractions.
        AC largely determines hydrosorption properties of soil due to a high content
        of organic matter and the predominance of swelling minerals in its composition,
        compared with WDC. The obtained data highlight the importance of studying
        clay fractions WDC and AC for the characteristics of differentiation and aggregation
        of the clay in soils.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10915-015-0086-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10915-015-0086-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10915-015-0086-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10915-015-0086-4\"}],\"title\":\"Erratum

        surgery is an acceptable alternative to open surgery in colorectal cancer

        Here, we proposed a prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate the
        radicalness and safety of laparoscopic D2 dissection for gastric cancer. From
        October 2010 to September 2012, 300 patients with gastric cancer were randomized
        to undergo either laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) or conventional open
        gastrectomy (OG) with D2 dissection. Clinicopathological parameters, recovery
        and complications were compared between these two groups. Thirty cases were
        excluded because of refusing to be involved in the trial, having peritoneal
        seeding metastasis or LAG conversed to OG, and finally 270 cases were analyzed
        (128 in LAG and 142 in OG). No significant differences were observed in gender,
        age, body mass index, stages and types of radical resection [radical proximal
        gastrectomy (PG\_+\_D2), radical distal gastrectomy (DG\_+\_D2) and radical
        total gastrectomy (TG\_+\_D2)] ( P \_\\u003e\_0.05). The number of harvested

        of the country, compared to the southern regions. This paper examines explanations
        for the regional fertility variations\u2014particularly the persistently high
        fertility rates observed in the northern regions\u2014paying particular attention
        to the contribution of socioeconomic, cultural and religious factors, and
        fertility attitudes among women in explaining this phenomenon. In order to
        capture the most recent fertility variations in the country, the paper uses
        the most recent round (2008) of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, and
        employs a Poisson multivariate estimation technique. Results indicate that
        regional differences in fertility are largely explained by socioeconomic factors
        such as urbanization, child mortality, education and household wealth. Cultural
        and religious factors also explain some of the observed variation between
        the northern region and the southern regions. The inclusion of the duration
        of post-partum amenorrhea and other proximate determinants in the model specifications
        significantly explains residual differences in fertility outcomes, particularly
        among the three northern regions. Findings therefore indicate a need for more
        region-specific policy targeting in the effort to reduce high fertility rates
        and ease the growth in population.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10854-015-3738-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10854-015-3738-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10854-015-3738-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10854-015-3738-0\"}],\"title\":\"Synthesis

        via the cerebrospinal fluid, close to the medullary receptors involved in
        the modulation of the nociceptive signal. This provides relief to patients
        who present with refractory pain despite elevated doses of opioids or those
        who present with severe treatment-related adverse effects. Its main advantage
        is the use of very low doses of opioids and the possibility of using analgesics
        that can only be administered via this route, such as local anaesthetics and
        ziconotide. This technique has been considerably developed over the last twenty
        years, especially in oncology, due to the availability of implanted pumps
        that are totally regulated by the patient. Implantation is generally carried
        out following the outcome of a multidisciplinary team meeting. Limited diffusion
        of analgesics in the CSF involves the implantation of the end of the catheter
        behind the spinal cord in the segments involved in the pain process. The use

        messageAlternative methods for genomic prediction of traits and trait differences
        are compared and recommendations made. We make recommendations for implementing
        methods in the context of DUS testing.AbstractHigh-throughput genotyping provides
        an opportunity to explore the application of genotypes in predicting plant
        phenotypes. We use a genome-wide prediction model to estimate the contribution
        of all loci and sum over multiple minor effects to predict traits. A potential
        use is in plant variety protection to discriminate among varieties on distinctness.
        We investigate this use with alternate scenarios in a set of 431 winter and
        spring barley varieties, with trait data from UK DUS trials comprising 28
        characteristics, together with SNP genotype data. Firstly, each trait is predicted
        from genotypes by ridge regression with discrimination among varieties using
        predicted traits. Secondly, squared trait differences between each pair of
        varieties are regressed on genetic distances between each variety by ridge
        regression, with discrimination among varieties using the predicted squared
        trait differences directly. This latter approach is analogous to the use of
        phenotype and marker differences introduced to human genetic linkage analysis
        by Haseman and Elston and to the analysis of heritability in natural populations
        of plants by Ritland. We compare correlations between methods, both trait
        by trait and summarised across all traits. Our results show wide variation
        among correlations for each trait. However, the aggregate distances calculated
        from values predicted by genotypes show higher correlations with distances
        calculated from measured values than any previously reported. We discuss the

        PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched
        for studies of the prevalence of major CVDs and risk factors, and of CVD mortality
        among Chinese immigrants. The search identified 386 papers, 16 of which met
        the inclusion criteria for this review. In mainland China, there is a pattern
        of high stroke prevalence but low coronary heart disease (CHD) prevalence.
        Among Chinese immigrants, there is a much lower prevalence and mortality of
        stroke, but a higher prevalence and mortality of CHD, even though these are
        lower than the rates in immigrants of other ethnicities in the host country.
        The prevalence of CVD risk factors is also markedly different in immigrants.
        Compared with mainland Chinese, Chinese immigrants have a higher prevalence
        of diabetes and hypertension, higher serum cholesterol, poorer dietary patterns,
        and higher prevalence of obesity and smoking. Thus, the epidemiological pattern
        of CVD among Chinese immigrants changes compared with resident mainland Chinese.
        The less healthy environmental factor after immigration may be a major trigger
        in the adverse CVD status of Chinese immigrants. It is important for policy-makers
        to pay more attention to specific minority immigrant groups, and to implement
        more effective preventive measures to improve the health of immigrant populations.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10761-015-0312-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10761-015-0312-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10761-015-0312-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10761-015-0312-7\"}],\"title\":\"At

        chemistry is one of the most studied controls on decomposition in terrestrial
        ecosystems. Solar radiation has been shown to increase litter decomposition
        rates in arid ecosystems through the process of photodegradation. However,
        it remains unclear how photodegradation affects litter chemistry, especially
        the abundance and composition of lignin, which is thought to play a key role
        in photodegradation. Using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D
        NMR) spectroscopic methods, we quantified the molecular-level changes in litter
        chemistry associated with photodegradation. Litter of Bromus diandrus was
        exposed in the field to two levels of radiation [with and without ultraviolet
        (UV) wavelengths] and two durations of exposure (2.5\_months during summer,
        and 1\_year). Through fiber analysis by sequential digestion, we found that
        the litter hemicellulose fraction decreased significantly from 31.6 to 24.9\_%
        after 1\_year of decomposition. In litter exposed for 1\_year, the hemicellulose
        fraction was significantly lower in litter with UV exposure compared to litter
        without UV exposure (23.8 vs. 25.9\_%). These results indicate that UV photodegradation
        has a small but significant effect on litter chemistry compared to other decomposition
        processes. Even though fiber analysis showed no loss of total lignin, 2D NMR
        analysis demonstrated that UV exposure reduced the major lignin structural
        units containing \u03B2-aryl ether inter-unit linkages by 9\_% and decreased
        the relative abundance of lignin p -hydroxyphenyl units by 20\_%. The 2D NMR
        analysis also revealed that lignin guaiacyl units were preferentially lost
        after 1\_year of decomposition relative to the reference material, but no
        effects of UV exposure on guaiacyl units were observed. These results suggest
        that photodegradation causes partial degradation, not necessarily complete
        breakdown, of lignin structures. Our data also demonstrate that applications
        of 2D NMR methods are valuable for acquiring detailed information on lignin
        and polysaccharide chemistry during both biotic and abiotic decomposition
        processes.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s41019-015-0002-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s41019-015-0002-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s41019-015-0002-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41019-015-0002-9\"}],\"title\":\"POS:

        reesei F-418, T. harzianum F-416, T. virdi e F-520, T. koningii F-322, Aspergillus
        oryzae FK-923, A. fumigatus F-993, and A. awamori F-524 were cultured on OC
        for 7\_days at 36\_\xB0C. Subsequently, the chemical composition and lignocellulolytic
        enzyme activities of the resultant substrate were determined.ResultsThe most
        promising result was obtained by A. oryzae FK-923, whereas, an increase in
        crude protein content ranging from 9.5\_% (untreated) to 17.4\_% (treated)
        was detected, while phenols were decreased from 3.1 to 0.92\_% and fibers
        declined from 33 to 22.2\_%. A reduction in the values of neutral detergent
        fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were reported. The addition of
        sugar cane molasses at 2\_% showed an increase in crude protein to 18.9\_%
        with a reduction in phenols and fibers to 0.69 and 21.8\_%, respectively.
        Furthermore, the addition of active dry yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae )
        at 1.5\_% to the fermentation medium raised the crude protein to 20.2\_% (w/w),
        while phenols and fibers were declined to 0.55 and 19.2\_%, respectively.ConclusionsTherefore,
        the present findings revealed A. oryzae FK-923 to be an efficient organism
        for lignocellulolytic enzymes production and simultaneous enhancement in crude
        protein and in vitro digestibility of OC.\"}],\"facets\":[{\"name\":\"subject\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"Medicine

        and aromatic compounds. The complete DNA content of the strain was previously
        sequenced and numerous oxygenase genes were identified. In order to identify
        the key elements participating in biodegradation of various hydrocarbons,
        we performed a comparative whole transcriptome analysis of cells grown on
        hexadecane, diesel oil and acetate. The transcriptomic data for the most prominent
        genes were validated by RT-qPCR. The expression of two genes coding for alkane-1-monooxygenase
        enzymes was highly upregulated in the presence of hydrocarbon substrates.
        The transcription of eight phylogenetically diverse cytochrome P450 ( cyp
        ) genes was upregulated in the presence of diesel oil. The transcript levels
        of various oxygenase genes were determined in cells grown in an artificial
        mixture, containing hexadecane, cycloparaffin and aromatic compounds and six
        cyp genes were induced by this hydrocarbon mixture. Five of them were not
        upregulated by linear and branched hydrocarbons. The expression of fatty acid
        synthase I genes was downregulated by hydrocarbon substrates, indicating the
        utilization of external alkanes for fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, the transcription
        of genes involved in siderophore synthesis, iron transport and exopolysaccharide
        biosynthesis was also upregulated, indicating their important role in hydrocarbon
        metabolism. Based on the results, complex metabolic response profiles were
        established for cells grown on various hydrocarbons. Our results represent
        a functional annotation of a rhodococcal genome, provide deeper insight into

        the two anti-diabetic drugs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) and
        glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP1RAs), have distinct
        effects on the dynamics of circulating incretins, little is known of the difference
        in their consequences on morphology and function of pancreatic islets. We
        examined these in a mouse model of \u03B2 cell injury/regeneration. The model
        mice were generated so as to express diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor and a
        fluorescent protein (Tomato) specifically in \u03B2 cells. The mice were treated
        with a DPP4i (MK-0626) and a GLP1RA (liraglutide), singly or doubly, and the
        morphology and function of the islets were compared. Prior administration
        of MK-0626 and/or liraglutide similarly protected \u03B2 cells from DT-induced
        cell death, indicating that enhanced GLP-1 signaling can account for the cytoprotection.
        However, 2-week intervention of MK-0626 and/or liraglutide in DT-injected
        mice resulted in different islet morphology and function: \u03B2 cell proliferation
        and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were increased by MK-0626
        but not by liraglutide; \u03B1 cell mass was decreased by liraglutide but
        not by MK-0626. Although liraglutide administration nullified MK-0626-induced
        \u03B2 cell proliferation, their co-administration resulted in increased GSIS,
        decreased \u03B1 cell mass, and improved glucose tolerance. The pro-proliferative
        effect of MK-0626 was lost by co-administration of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist
        exendin-(9-39), indicating that GLP-1 signaling is required for this effect.
        Comparison of the effects of DPP4is and/or GLP1RAs treatment in a single mouse
        model shows that the two anti-diabetic drugs have distinct consequences on
        islet morphology and function.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10884-015-9483-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10884-015-9483-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10884-015-9483-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10884-015-9483-5\"}],\"title\":\"Second

        purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ormeloxifene with medroxyprogesterone
        acetate in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding.Material and Method440
        Patients were divided into two groups. In group A, ormeloxifene was given
        at the dosage of 60\_mg twice a week for 3\_months followed by 60\_mg once
        a week for 1\_month. In group B, medroxyprogesterone acetate was given at
        the dosage of 10\_mg twice a day from day 5 to day 25 of the menstrual cycle.
        At follow-ups, patients were assessed for PBAC score, endometrial thickness
        by USG, hemoglobin level, and the side effects of drug therapy.ResultsThere
        were 240 patients in group A and 200 in group B. Reduction in median PBAC
        score was 79.4\_% in group A and 75\_% in group B after 4\_months of treatment.
        The mean duration of bleeding reduced to 4.8 from 9 in group A and 5 from
        8.7 in group B. Mean hemoglobin was increased from 8.6 to 9.8\_g\_% in group

        drugs traditionally used for treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis are mainly
        toxic, ineffective for some parasite isolates, and costly. Since chitosan
        is reported to accelerate wound healing, the aims of this study were to assess
        the effectiveness of nanochitosan films in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis
        caused by Leishmania major (Iranian strain) and to investigate alterations
        of antioxidant enzyme activities and malondialdehyde levels. Six weeks after
        L. major inoculation, when lesions appeared at the base of the tail of 36
        female Balb/c mice, treatment was initiated. Lesion sizes, parasite proliferation,
        histopathological changes, antioxidant enzyme activities, and malondialdehyde
        changes were evaluated in groups treated with nanochitosan film and groups
        treated with the combination of nanochitosan film and daily peritoneal injection
        of glucantime. There was no significant difference between nanochitosan and
        glucantime in reduction of lesion size. But, lesion sizes in the group that
        was treated with a combination of nanochitosan film and glucantime were significantly
        reduced from 2\_weeks after treatment. The results of the present study showed
        that application of nanochitosan film increased the wound contraction rate,
        reepithelialization rate, and scar tissue formation, and its combination with
        glucantime significantly reduced lesion size and parasite loads. Nanochitosan
        films alone or in combination with glucantime enhanced glutathione peroxidase
        (GPX) activity and decreased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. The

        of our study was to investigate the effect of metformin use on pathological
        response as well as overall and disease-free survival in patients with resectable

        undergoing an esophagectomy for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer
        after neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy with curative intent were included in
        a prospective database. A complete pathological response was defined as ypT0N0M0,
        Mandard 1. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves with log-rank testing were performed for
        overall survival and disease-free survival.ResultsA total of 461 patients

        marshlands may provide ecosystem services but their vegetation and related

        step to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation and detect on-going
        changes. However, it is still a challenge to produce reliable vegetation maps
        at the regional scale. This study aims to evaluate the potential of new Landsat-8
        imageries (acquired in September and December 2013) for mapping fine-grained
        plant communities in coastal marshlands. Field-based vegetation maps were
        collected for 270\_km of marshlands along the French Atlantic coast. In order
        to be identifiable on the satellite image, fine-grained vegetation units were
        aggregated into fewer plant community combinations. The classification accuracy
        was assessed by comparison with field-based vegetation data and compared between
        the supervised methods used, including Minimum Distance, Mahalanobis, Maximum
        Likelihood, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The best result was
        obtained with the Maximum Likelihood classifier and by combining the two Landsat-8

        (NEO-PI-R) and the temperament and character inventory (TCI). Six months later,
        adolescents were asked to write down the most positive or the most negative
        event that had happened to them in the last 3\_months. Adolescents were explicitly
        instructed to answer the following questions within their narratives: What

        when it happened? How do you think the involved persons felt? The descriptions

        obstructive hydrocephalus models were induced in ten Sprague\u2013Dawley rats
        with kaolin injection into the cisterna magna. Three weeks after the kaolin
        injection, when thick arachnoid fibrosis obliterated the fourth ventricular
        outlets, cationized ferritin was stereotactically infused as a tracer into
        the lateral ventricle in order to observe the pathways from the ventricles
        to the subarachnoid space. Animals were killed in 48\_h and brains were sectioned.
        CSF flow pathways were traced by the staining of ferritin with ferrocyanide.ResultsEight
        out of ten rats developed hydrocephalus. The subarachnoid membranes of the
        convexity and basal cisterns were severely adhered such that most of the ferritin
        remained in the ventricles whereas basal and convexity cisterns were clear
        of ferritin. In six out of the eight hydrocephalus rats, ferritin leaked from

        (74\u2009\xB1\u200917\_%), which had still not fully recovered after 17\_days.
        This also halved juvenile density and caused negative growth. One percent

        treatment of 0.5\_% KI and 0.38\_% NaClO had far milder effects: reducing
        adult and juveniles F_q ^\u2019/F_m ^\u2019 by 6\u2009\xB1\u20093 and 34\u2009\xB1\u20099\_%
        respectively, with full recovery by day 10. A reduction in juvenile growth
        was also seen between day 0\u201310 (32\_%); however, size was no different
        to the control by day 20. This combined treatment is therefore suitable for
        decontamination of both juveniles and adult S. muticum tissue.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00702-015-1450-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00702-015-1450-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00702-015-1450-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00702-015-1450-0\"}],\"title\":\"Three

        severe outcomes, phenylketonuria (PKU) must be detected as soon as possible
        after birth and managed with life-long treatment. A questionnaire-based survey
        was performed to document diagnosis and management practices for PKU in a
        region of Southern and Eastern Europe. Prevalence and management data were
        obtained from 37/59 (63\_%) centres within 19/22 (86\_%) contacted countries
        ( N \u2009=\u20098600 patients). The main results\u2019 analysis was based
        on completed questionnaires obtained from 31 centres (53\_%) within 15 countries
        (68\_%). A median of 10\_% of patients per centre had been diagnosed after
        the newborn period. Metabolic dieticians and specialised adult PKU clinics
        were lacking in 36 and 84\_% of centres, respectively. In 26\_% of centres,
        treatment initiation was delayed until \\u003e15\_days of life. Blood phenylalanine
        (Phe) thresholds to start treatment and upper Phe targets were inconsistent
        across centres. Ten percent of centres reported monitoring Phe every 2\_weeks
        for pregnant women with PKU, which is insufficient to minimise risk of neonatal
        sequalae. Sapropterin dihydrochloride treatment was available in 48\_% of
        centres, with 24-h responsiveness tests most common (36\_%). Only one centre
        among the five countries lacking newborn screening provided a completed questionnaire.
        Conclusion : Targeted efforts by health care professionals and governments
        are needed to optimise diagnostic and management approaches for PKU in Southern
        and Eastern Europe. \u201C What is Known \u201D \u2022 PKU must be detected
        early and optimally managed throughout life to avoid poor outcomes, yet newborn
        screening is not universal and diagnostic and management practices for PKU
        are known to vary widely between different centres and countries. \u2022 Targeted
        efforts by health care professionals and governments are needed to optimise

        screening in all countries, increased number of metabolic dietitians and specialised
        adult PKU clinics, delayed time to treatment initiation, appropriate Phe thresholds,
        Phe targets and monitoring frequencies, and universal access to currently

        for the production of methane containing biogas is the classic example of
        a resource recovery process that combines stabilization of particulate organic
        matter or wastewater treatment with the production of a valuable end-product.
        Attractive features of the process include the production of a single end-product
        from a heterogeneous feedstock, and in-situ product separation of the gaseous
        end-product. Despite these intrinsic attractive properties of the process,
        the economic added value of the biogas produced is limited, enabling the development
        of alternative processes that yield higher-value end-products. Typically the
        production of higher value end-products from low value feedstock and industrial
        wastewater proceeds via intermediate production of organic acids (and carbon
        dioxide and molecular hydrogen). Optimization of organic acid production from
        particulate feedstocks and wastewater for development of the organic acid
        based resource recovery route receives significant research attention. The
        organic acid stream generated as such, has no economic value, but if organic
        acids can either be concentrated via membrane separation or (bio)converted
        to an end-product that can easily be separated from the liquid, an attractive
        biomass processing scheme can be developed. Attractive end-products of organic
        acid processing include polyhydroxyalkanoates, medium chain length fatty acids,
        or other organic molecules using bio-electrochemical systems. Overall we suggest
        that these novel bioprocessing routes for conversion of low value feedstock
        to higher added value products will contribute to a sustainable future and
        will change the economic status of organic waste.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11306-015-0837-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11306-015-0837-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11306-015-0837-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11306-015-0837-0\"}],\"title\":\"A

        protocols. Here we describe the development and validation of a phytohormone
        profiling protocol, based on methyl-chloroformate derivatisation of the plant
        metabolites and analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS).
        We describe the analysis of 11 metabolites, either plant phytohormones or
        intermediates of phytohormone metabolism; ABA, azelaic acid, IAA, JA and SA,
        and the phytohormone precursors 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid, benzoic
        acid, cinnamic acid, 13-epi-12-oxophytodienoic acid (13-epi-OPDA), linoleic
        acid and linolenic acid, and validate the isolation from foliar tissue of
        the model legume Medicago truncatula . The preparation is insensitive to the
        presence of water, facilitating measurement of the volatile metabolites. Quantitation
        was linear over four orders of magnitude, and the limits of detection between
        two and 10\_ng/mL for all measured metabolites using a single quadrupole GC\u2013MS.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13538-015-0365-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13538-015-0365-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13538-015-0365-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13538-015-0365-4\"}],\"title\":\"Vibrational

        has been carried out using density functional theory calculations. The vibrational
        spectra of the molecule is simulated theoretically and compared experimentally,
        and the vibrational frequencies are assigned on the basis of potential energy
        distribution calculations. Electronic properties of the molecule derived from
        the theoretical ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrum are validated experimentally.
        The higher non-linear optical activity of the molecule is indicated in the
        first-order hyperpolarizability calculations. The natural bond orbital and
        Mulliken atomic charge distribution analysis confirm intramolecular charge

        the pyridine ring of AMNP molecule and the lone pair of oxygen is a common

        this study, probabilistic projections of precipitation for the Province of
        Ontario are developed through a regional climate model ensemble to help investigate
        how global warming would affect its local climate. The PRECIS regional climate
        modeling system is employed to perform ensemble simulations, driven by a set
        of boundary conditions from a HadCM3-based perturbed-physics ensemble. The
        PRECIS ensemble simulations are fed into a Bayesian hierarchical model to
        quantify uncertain factors affecting the resulting projections of precipitation
        and thus generate probabilistic precipitation changes at grid point scales.
        Following that, reliable precipitation projections throughout the twenty-first
        century are developed for the entire province by applying the probabilistic
        changes to the observed precipitation. The results show that the vast majority
        of cities in Ontario are likely to suffer positive changes in annual precipitation
        in 2030, 2050, and 2080\_s in comparison to the baseline observations. This
        may suggest that the whole province is likely to gain more precipitation throughout
        the twenty-first century in response to global warming. The analyses on the
        projections of seasonal precipitation further demonstrate that the entire
        province is likely to receive more precipitation in winter, spring, and autumn
        throughout this century while summer precipitation is only likely to increase
        slightly in 2030\_s and would decrease gradually afterwards. However, because
        the magnitude of projected decrease in summer precipitation is relatively
        small in comparison with the anticipated increases in other three seasons,
        the annual precipitation over Ontario is likely to suffer a progressive increase
        throughout the twenty-first century (by 7.0\_% in 2030\_s, 9.5\_% in 2050\_s,
        and 12.6\_% in 2080\_s). Besides, the degree of uncertainty for precipitation
        projections is analyzed. The results suggest that future changes in spring
        precipitation show higher degree of uncertainty than other seasons, resulting
        in more uncertainties in annual precipitation projections.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s40703-015-0009-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s40703-015-0009-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40703-015-0009-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40703-015-0009-0\"}],\"title\":\"Two

        this research, Two and three-dimensional slope stability analyses of final
        slope for Miduk copper mine is investigated by using distinct element code.
        These analyses were repeated in three positions (dry- drained- wet) and were
        done for four walls of the mine; including eastern wall, northern wall, western
        wall and southern wall.MethodsThe stability of Miduk copper mine walls were
        accomplished by distinct element code (UDEC\\u00263DEC). Both 2D and 3D slope
        stability analyses were performed to establish the representative shear strength
        parameters to use in the analyses and to examine the differences in the results.
        The extended Mohr\u2013Coulomb failure criterion was used for analyses. The
        rock mass was assumed to be permeable and also by the obtained data from surveying,
        laboratory tests and field observations.ResultsThe results are as follows:
        - Water and pore pressure in the faults and main joints were the most important
        destabilizer factors in these analyses. - The factor of safety after the drainage
        improved (27\u201334) % and (20\u201328) % based on the 3D and 2D slope stability
        analyses, respectively. - The difference in factors of safety between the
        2D and 3D slope stability analyses for the deeper groundwater table (water
        level in the elevation 2540 on the walls) is less than 7 %.ConclusionThe factors
        of safety obtained from 2D slope stability analyses are not necessarily more
        conservative than 3D slope stability analyses. Analyses of the slope after
        lowering of groundwater table by horizontal drains showed that the factor
        of safety of the slope has improved tremendously. The differences in factors
        of safety for 2D and 3D slope stability analyses are greater for low groundwater
        table as compared with those for high groundwater table. The results illustrated
        how 3D slope stability analyses have become less daunting to perform and can
        be incorporated into routine slope designs.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13238-015-0205-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13238-015-0205-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13238-015-0205-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13238-015-0205-x\"}],\"title\":\"Crystal

        is an active but relatively toxic chemotherapeutic regimen for patients with

        institutional experience with FOLFIRINOX for therapy-na\xEFve patients with
        locally advanced and initially unresectable PDAC.MethodsAll patients with
        unresectable locally advanced PDAC who underwent treatment with FOLFIRINOX
        at a single center between 2011 and 2014 were identified and evaluated retrospectively
        regarding chemotherapy response, toxicity, conversion to resectability, and
        survival. Resectability, response to chemotherapy, and postoperative complications
        were reported according to NCCN-guidelines, RECIST-criteria, and Clavien\u2013Dindo-classification,
        respectively.ResultsOverall, 14 patients received FOLFIRINOX as first-line
        therapy for locally advanced and unresectable PDAC. Fifty-seven percent of
        the patients had severe tumor-related comorbidities at the time of diagnosis,
        and in 86\_%, dose reduction due to toxicity was necessary during a median
        of seven cycles. Nevertheless, only one patient had progressive disease during
        FOLFIRINOX, whereas the others experienced stable disease ( n \_=\_6) or partial
        remission ( n \_=\_6; no restaging in one patient). Oncological tumor resection
        was possible in 4 patients (29\_% of all patients) with no postoperative mortality
        and only one grade 2 surgical complication. After a median follow-up of 10\_months,

        salt can be used as backfill to bury and conduct heat away from radioactive
        waste in salt repositories. As the crushed salt compacts during reconsolidation,
        its thermal, mechanical and hydrologic properties will change in a manner
        related to the porosity. Measurements of crushed salt thermal properties are
        conducted to evaluate such relationships. A simple mixture theory model is
        presented to predict thermal conductivity of consolidating salt in repository
        conditions. Experimental work was completed to evaluate the model by measuring
        thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat of crushed salt
        as a function of porosity and temperature. Sample porosity ranged from 0 to
        46\_%, and measurements were made at ambient pressure, from room temperature
        to 300\_\xB0C. These are the temperature conditions expected in a radioactive
        waste storage facility. Crushed salt thermal conductivity decreases with increasing
        porosity and temperature. Thermal diffusivity showed little porosity dependence
        but decreased with increasing temperature. Specific heat also shows little
        porosity dependence but increases with increasing temperature. Fracture porosity
        in deformed bedded salt cores appears to reduce thermal conductivity more
        dramatically than inter- and intra-granular porosity in consolidated salt.
        A long-term effort to dry crushed salt at high temperatures resulted in a
        0.48 weight-percent loss of water that had resided at grain boundaries and
        in intra-granular fluid inclusions. While this loss does not significantly
        affect thermal properties, the release of this water volume could impact the
        mechanical response of the reconsolidating salt and host rock.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00436-015-4713-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00436-015-4713-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00436-015-4713-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4713-7\"}],\"title\":\"\\n

        was to investigate whether cod larvae could synthesis PL from sn -2-monoacylglycerol
        (2-MAG) and glycerol precursors. A tube feeding method was used to deliver
        equal molar aliquots of 2-oleoyl-[1,2,3-^3H]glycerol and [U-^14C] glycerol
        together with bovine serum albumin (BSA) bound 16:0 (palmitic acid) and 22:6n-3

        of anesthetized cod larvae and thereafter monitoring the metabolism of these
        components in the larvae through 4\_h following injection. Our results showed
        that both 2-MAG and glycerol precursors contributed to the de novo synthesis
        of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and the 2-MAG pathway predominated over the G-3-P
        (glycerol-3-phosphate) pathway in the synthesis of TAG and PC. The molecular
        ratio of PC/TAG obtained from the 2-MAG and the G-3-P pathways was 0.44\u20130.74
        and 1.02\u20132.06 within the first hour of tube feeding, suggesting they
        might have comparable biosynthesis ability of PC and TAG under the conditions
        of the present study. Furthermore, supplementation of choline chloride significantly
        increased PC/TAG ratio ( p \_\\u003c\_0.05) for both pathways. However, further
        studies are needed to quantify the enzyme activity involved in the CDP-choline
        (cytidine diphosphate choline) pathway, and the function of choline either
        in simulating PC synthesis or TAG catabolism or both needs further investigation.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10971-015-3857-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10971-015-3857-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10971-015-3857-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10971-015-3857-3\"}],\"title\":\"Ultralow-density

        of measurements on radiographs is influenced by the techniques by which the

        errors in the image and/or image examinations at two points in time may result
        in wrongful registrations of true biological or pathological changes. The
        aim of the present study was to propose and evaluate an indirect radiological
        examination technique, by which bias, when measuring radiographic bone level,
        could be substantially reduced as compared to the technique using direct mm
        measurements.MethodsA plugin to ImageJ was designed to reduce bias when measuring
        bone loss on radiographic images. In human dry mandibles, radiographic images
        of 20 teeth were obtained parallel with the tooth axis (alpha\u2009=\u20090)
        and at an angle of 30\xB0 deviation. The direct technique of measuring radiographic
        bone level (RBL) and the indirect, length-adjusted RBL were registered by
        four researchers in a double blinded fashion.ResultsWhen mean RBL measured

        of myocardial infarction. In this study, ADSCs were isolated from subcutaneous

        into the left ventricular wall in a rat myocardial infarction model. The structural
        and functional outcomes resulting from this transplantation were determined
        through detailed histological analysis and echocardiography. The graft size

        The ADSCs were able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells

        CIAD in patients with ischemic stroke is less clear.MethodsWe retrospectively
        analyzed 1013 patients with acute ischemic stroke who were consecutively admitted
        to the Department of Neurology, Charit\xE9 - Universit\xE4tsmedizin Berlin,
        Germany within one year. Mean follow-up was 80\_months (IQR 32\u201385 months).
        Using multivariable regression models we analyzed the impact of CIAD (defined
        as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma bronchiale) on stroke severity
        and outcome.ResultsCo-existing CIAD was evident in 7.1\_% ( n \u2009=\u200972)
        of all patients with acute ischemic stroke. Baseline characteristics of stroke
        patients with CIAD did not differ significantly from ischemic stroke patients
        without CIAD. Age (OR 1.17 [95\_% CI 1.03-1.37] per decade), atrial fibrillation
        (OR 3.43 [95\_% CI 2.47-4.78]) and coronary artery disease (OR 1.51 [95\_%

        magnetoelectric (ME) materials have been studied for new applications such
        as memory, energy harvesters, and magnetic field sensors. Herein, with the
        widely studied and progressive advantages of ME phenomena in the multiferroic
        field, we demonstrate a new approach for utilizing flexible ME materials as
        gate dielectric layers in ME organic field-effect transistors (ME-OFET) that
        can be used for sensing a magnetic field and extracting the ME properties
        of the gate dielectric itself. The magnetoelectric nanohybrid gate dielectric
        layer comprises sandwiched stacks of magnetostrictive CoFe_2O_4 nanoparticles
        and a highly piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene)
        layer. While varying the magnetic field applied to the ME gate dielectric,
        the ME effect in the functional gate dielectric modulates the channel conductance
        of the ME-OFET owing to a change in the effective gate field. The clear separation
        of the ME responses in the gate dielectric layer of ME-OFET from those of
        the other parameters was demonstrated using the AC gate biasing method and
        enabled the extraction of the ME coefficient of ME materials. Additionally,
        the device shows high stability after cyclic bending of 10,000 cycles at a
        banding radius of 1.2 cm. The device has significant potential for not only
        the extraction of the intrinsic characterization of ME materials but also

        two-length scale, second moment turbulence model (Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes,
        RANS) is proposed to capture a wide variety of single-phase flows, spanning
        from incompressible flows with single fluids and mixtures of different density
        fluids (variable density flows) to flows over shock waves. The two-length
        scale model was developed to address an inconsistency present in the single-length
        scale models, e.g. the inability to match both variable density homogeneous
        Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence and Rayleigh-Taylor induced turbulence, as well
        as the inability to match both homogeneous shear and free shear flows. The
        two-length scale model focuses on separating the decay and transport length
        scales, as the two physical processes are generally different in inhomogeneous
        turbulence. This allows reasonable comparisons with statistics and spreading
        rates over such a wide range of turbulent flows using a common set of model
        coefficients. The specific canonical flows considered for calibrating the
        model include homogeneous shear, single-phase incompressible shear driven
        turbulence, variable density homogeneous Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence, Rayleigh-Taylor
        induced turbulence, and shocked isotropic turbulence. The second moment model
        shows to compare reasonably well with direct numerical simulations (DNS),
        experiments, and theory in most cases. The model was then applied to variable
        density shear layer and shock tube data and shows to be in reasonable agreement
        with DNS and experiments. The importance of using DNS to calibrate and assess
        RANS type turbulence models is also highlighted.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12664-015-0585-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12664-015-0585-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12664-015-0585-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12664-015-0585-0\"}],\"title\":\"Endoscopic

        of the most common and serious complications of hepatic hydatid cyst disease
        is communication between the cyst and the biliary tree. Surgical management
        of biliary fistula is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We retrospectively
        reviewed the effectiveness of endoscopic treatment of ruptured hydatid cyst
        into intrahepatic bile ducts. Diagnosis of intrabiliary rupture of hydatid
        cyst was mostly suspected by acute cholangitis, jaundice, pain, and/or persistent
        external biliary fistula after surgery. The diagnosis was confirmed by radiology
        and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) findings. We retrospectively
        reviewed clinical, laboratory, imagery, and ERCP findings for all patients.
        The therapeutic methods performed were endoscopic sphincterotomy, extraction
        by balloon or Dormia basket, stenting, or nasobiliary drainage. Sixteen patients
        with ruptured hepatic hydatid cyst into bile ducts were seen in 9\_years.
        Nine of 16 patients had a surgical history of hepatic hydatid cyst and three
        patients had a percutanous treatment history. We carried out ERCP with sphincterotomy
        and extraction of hydatid materials (extraction balloon n \u2009=\u200911;
        Dormia basket n \u2009=\u20095) or biliary drainage (nasobiliary drainage
        n \u2009=\u20091; biliary stenting n \u2009=\u20091). The fistula healed in
        80\_% of patients with a median time of 6\_weeks [range, 1\u201312] after
        endoscopic treatment. ERCP was an effective method of treatment for hepatic

        acidification is causing changes to the chemistry and biology of the marine
        environment, in ways that we are only just beginning to understand. Growing
        evidences demonstrate that ocean acidification can influence the survival,
        growth, development, and physiology of marine invertebrates. Here, we assessed
        the impact of ocean acidification on the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus
        larval development (from embryos exposed to experimental conditions from the
        24\_h gastrula stage to 35\_days) and settlement. Samples were collected from
        the Canary Islands (28\xB024\u2032N, 16\xB018\u2032W) in March 2012. Three
        pH treatments were tested: (1) pH 8.1, the present average pH; (2) pH 7.7,
        the average predicted for the year 2100, but already experienced in the natural
        environment during extremes of variability; and (3) pH 7.4, predicted extremes
        of natural variability by 2100. The mortality rate was significantly increased
        by 40\_% at the lowest pH. Time required by larvae to achieve each developmental
        stage (from gastrula to competent stage) was decreased at pH 7.7 (larval development
        speed increased by 18\_%), but larval morphology at a given size did not differ
        from the other pH treatments. Settlement was delayed by 8\_days at pH 7.7
        compared to pH 8.1, and no settlement was observed at pH 7.4. Overall, only
        sublethal effects were observed in larvae exposed to pH 7.7, while pH 7.4
        induced both lethal and sublethal effects. Our results support the hypothesis
        that P. lividus is robust to survive in an environment with the present natural
        variation. However, the species is sensitive to extreme levels of pH that
        are predicted within the next 90\_years.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1245/s10434-015-4852-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1245/s10434-015-4852-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1245/s10434-015-4852-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1245/s10434-015-4852-1\"}],\"title\":\"Metastatic

        We discuss the structure of nonnegative equilibria and their stability analysis.
        Also, the invariance and boundedness of the model system are investigated.
        It is observed that delay destabilizes the system when the value of delay
        crosses its critical value. When the delay parameter is taken equals to its
        critical value, Hopf bifurcation occurs. Conditions for the system to become
        globally asymptotically stable at nonzero equilibria are also obtained. By
        applying the normal form theory and center manifold theorem, stability, direction,
        and period of bifurcating solutions of the model system are calculated. It
        is observed that supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs for a set of parameter

        To gain insight on the molecular basis for the heterogeneity among C9ORF72
        mutation carriers, we evaluated associations between features of disease and
        levels of two abundantly expressed \u201Cc9RAN proteins\u201D produced by
        repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation of the expanded repeat. For these
        studies, we took a departure from traditional immunohistochemical approaches
        and instead employed immunoassays to quantitatively measure poly(GP) and poly(GA)
        levels in cerebellum, frontal cortex, motor cortex, and/or hippocampus from
        55 C9ORF72 mutation carriers [12 patients with ALS, 24 with frontotemporal
        lobar degeneration (FTLD) and 19 with FTLD with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND)].
        We additionally investigated associations between levels of poly(GP) or poly(GA)
        and cognitive impairment in 15 C9ORF72 ALS patients for whom neuropsychological
        data were available. Among the neuroanatomical regions investigated, poly(GP)
        levels were highest in the cerebellum. In this same region, associations between
        poly(GP) and both neuropathological and clinical features were detected. Specifically,
        cerebellar poly(GP) levels were significantly lower in patients with ALS compared
        to patients with FTLD or FTLD-MND. Furthermore, cerebellar poly(GP) associated
        with cognitive score in our cohort of 15 patients. In the cerebellum, poly(GA)
        levels similarly trended lower in the ALS subgroup compared to FTLD or FTLD-MND
        subgroups, but no association between cerebellar poly(GA) and cognitive score
        was detected. Both cerebellar poly(GP) and poly(GA) associated with C9ORF72
        variant 3 mRNA expression, but not variant 1 expression, repeat size, disease
        onset, or survival after onset. Overall, these data indicate that cerebellar

        Stavelot-Venn inlier (also called as the Stavelot-Venn Massif) exposes a thick
        series of sedimentary rocks that have been intensely deformed and fractured
        by two succeeding orogenies (Caledonian and Hercynian). In addition, the Massif
        has been metamorphised into greenschists (at least at its southern border),
        subsequently cut by a large collapse structure (the Graben of Malmedy) and
        is still subjected to vertical tectonic movements. The geology of the Massif
        is quite distinct from that of the surrounding Devonian-Carboniferous strata.
        The rocks that built it, as well as their complex geological histories, created
        a particular landscape that is of great biological and geological interest;
        this has led to the creation of the High Fens Natural Park. Its subcrop encloses
        many peculiarities of regional, international or even global importance: e.g.
        manganese and molybdenum mineral deposits, slightly mineralised and ferruginous
        waters and sharpening stones made of \u2018coticule\u2019. The building stones
        extracted from the Massif (slates, quartzites) and from its borders (arkoses,
        sandstones) provide a characteristic look to the built environment and to
        other smaller heritage objects. Some relicts of the former mining activities
        have been used for touristic purposes (e.g. the slate quarry of Recht, the
        Museum of the Coticule); others have evolved into natural sanctuaries for
        rare or even exceptional faunas and floras, while some others have been deliberately
        abandoned to evolve freely. The conservation of the extensive peat bogs of
        the High Fens receives international attention and support. Clusters of \u2018viviers\u2019
        (ramparted and closed remnants of Pleistocene lithalsas) within this peat
        bog landscape are unique witnesses of subarctic conditions that ruled here
        during the youngest ice age. The cities of Spa and Chevron are true cities
        of water: the former is internationally renowned, having given its name to
        the famous and popular spa. The natural and geological heritage assets of
        the Stavelot-Venn Massif are thus multiple and interrelated: stunning landscapes,
        interesting former mining activities, exceptional ecosystems, excellent mineral
        waters and attractive local building stones. However, a holistic project integrating
        all of the latter components has still to be launched and is waiting for regional,
        national and international support. The Massif is well positioned between
        Belgium and Germany and covers different administrative units, offering excellent
        opportunities for creating a cross-border Geopark.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11663-015-0451-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11663-015-0451-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11663-015-0451-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11663-015-0451-6\"}],\"title\":\"Mathematical

        various nanofillers for composite systems, carbon-based fillers such as graphite,
        carbon fibers, carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc. are attracting
        great attention in both academia and industry for the advent of highly integrated
        electronic devices. The objective in fabricating such composite materials
        is to obtain distinct properties evolved from the synergistic effects of the
        component materials that may be exploited for various applications such as
        electronics and optical devices. In the present work, polyurethane/graphite
        composites have been synthesized with the aim of using them for electromagnetic
        shielding applications. The polyurethane/graphite composites were prepared
        through an in situ polymerization method in the presence of graphite nanoparticles.
        The prepared composites were characterized by scanning electron microscope,
        transmission electron microscope (TEM), and x-ray diffraction techniques.
        The shifting of the major peak of graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) in prepared
        nanocomposites towards the left from 26.336\xB0 d -spacing\_=\_3.381\_\xC5

        intercalation type of dispersion in the prepared nanocomposites. This was
        further validated with the TEM characterization. The introduction of GNPs
        in polyurethane (PU) during in situ polymerization creates an electrical network
        in the resulting composite, which therefore makes it highly conductive. The
        prepared nanocomposite showed an electrical network at 2.2\_vol.% of the percolation
        threshold in DC condition and a similar percolation threshold was found at
        100\_Hz in AC conditions. The maximum conductivity found at 6.5\_vol.% of
        filler loading was 0.01\_S/cm. The resulting composites were evaluated for
        electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding at different filler loadings.
        The prepared PU/GNPs composites were found to be highly effective with shielding
        effectiveness of 19.34\_dB, and with electromagnetic interference shielding

        Aedes togoi mosquitoes were maintained to harvest infective third stage larvae,
        which were then injected into male Mongolian gerbils. Subsequently, adult
        B. pahangi were obtained from the infected gerbil for genomic DNA extraction.
        Sequencing and subsequently, construction of genomic libraries were performed.
        This was followed by genomic analyses and gene annotation analysis. By using
        archived protein sequences of B. malayi and a few other nematodes, clustering
        of gene orthologs and phylogenetics were conducted.ResultsA total of 9687

        to that B. malayi genome, particularly genes annotated to fundamental processes.
        Nevertheless, 166 genes were considered to be unique to B. pahangi , which
        may be responsible for the distinct properties of B. pahangi as compared to

        fatigue is a major source of failure of solder joints in surface mount electronic
        components and it is critically important in high reliability applications
        such as telecommunication, military, and aeronautics. The electronic packaging
        industry has seen an increase in the number of Pb-free solder alloy choices
        beyond the common near-eutectic Sn-Ag-Cu alloys first established as replacements
        for eutectic SnPb. This paper discusses the results from Pb-free solder joint
        reliability programs sponsored by two industry consortia. The characteristic
        life in accelerated thermal cycling is reported for 12 different Pb-free solder
        alloys and a SnPb control in 9 different accelerated thermal cycling test
        profiles in terms of the effects of component type, accelerated thermal cycling
        profile and dwell time. Microstructural analysis on assembled and failed samples
        was performed to investigate the effect of initial microstructure and its
        evolution during accelerated thermal cycling test. A significant finding from
        the study is that the beneficial effect of Ag on accelerated thermal cycling
        reliability (measured by characteristic lifetime) diminishes as the severity
        of the accelerated thermal cycling, defined by greater \u0394 T , higher peak

        all the Pb-free solders are more reliable in accelerated thermal cycling than
        the SnPb alloy they have replaced. Suggestions are made for future work, particularly
        with respect to the continued evolution of alloy development for emerging

        by jasmonic acid, plays a central role in regulating the TIA pathway. In this
        study, overexpressing ORCA3 under the control of a glucocorticoid-inducible
        promoter in C. roseus hairy roots resulted in no change in the total amount
        of TIAs measured. RT-qPCR results showed that ORCA3 overexpression triggered
        the upregulation of transcripts of most of the known TIA pathway genes. One
        notable exception was the decrease in strictosidine glucosidase ( SGD ) transcripts.
        These results corresponded to previously published results. In this study,
        ORCA3 and SGD were both engineered in hairy roots under the control of a glucocorticoid-inducible
        promoter. Co-overexpression of ORCA3 and SGD resulted in a significant ( p
        \u2009\\u003c\u20090.05) increase in serpentine by 44\_%, ajmalicine by 32\_%,
        catharanthine by 38\_%, tabersonine by 40\_%, lochnericine by 60\_% and h\xF6rhammericine
        by 56\_% . The total alkaloid pool was increased significantly by 47\_%. Thus,
        combining overexpression of a positive regulator and a pathway gene which
        is not controlled by this regulator provided a way to enhance alkaloid production.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00477-015-1140-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00477-015-1140-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00477-015-1140-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-015-1140-3\"}],\"title\":\"Regional

        The Author(s)\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractBovine tuberculosis
        (TB) is a chronic disease in cattle that causes a serious food security challenge
        to the agricultural industry in terms of dairy and meat production. Spatio-temporal
        disease analysis in terms of time trends and geographic disparities of disease
        dynamics can provide useful insights into the overall efficiency of control
        efforts as well as the relative efficiency of different management measures
        towards eradication. In GB, Scotland has had a risk based surveillance testing
        policy under which high risk herds are tested frequently, and in September
        2009 was officially declared as TB free. Wales have had an annual or more
        frequent testing policy for all cattle herds since January 2010, while in
        England several herds are still tested every 4\_years except some high TB
        prevalence areas where annual testing is applied. Time series analysis using
        publicly available data for total tests on herds, total cattle slaughtered,
        new herd incidents, and herds not TB free, were analysed globally for GB and
        locally for the constituent regions of Wales, Scotland, West, North, and East
        England. After detecting trends over time, underlying regional differences
        were compared with the testing policies in the region. Total cattle slaughtered
        are decreasing in Wales, Scotland and West England, but increasing in the
        North and East English regions. New herd incidents, i.e., disease incidence,
        are decreasing in Wales, Scotland, West English region, but increasing in
        North and East English regions. Herds not TB free, i.e., disease prevalence,
        are increasing in West, North, and East English regions, while they are decreasing
        in Wales and Scotland. Total cattle slaughtered were positively correlated
        with total tests in the West, North, and East English regions, with high slopes
        of regression indicating that additional testing is likely to facilitate the
        eradication of the disease. There was no correlation between total cattle
        slaughtered and total tests on herds in Wales indicating that herds are tested
        frequent enough in order to detect all likely cases and so control TB. The
        main conclusion of the analysis conducted here is that more frequent testing
        is leading to lower TB infections in cattle both in terms of TB prevalence
        as well as TB incidence.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10029-015-1419-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10029-015-1419-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10029-015-1419-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1419-9\"}],\"title\":\"Retrospective

        resulting from the closure of temporary stomas have a high risk of developing
        an incisional hernia (IH) with incidences around 30\_% in studies designed
        to investigate this outcome. A temporary diverting ileostomy (TDI) is often
        used in patients after low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer.MethodsThe
        OSTRICH study is a retrospective cohort study of rectal cancer patients who
        had a LAR with a reversed TDI and at least one CT scan during follow-up. Two
        radiologists independently evaluated all abdominal CT scans to diagnose IH
        at the ileostomy wound and additionally, IH at the laparotomy site.ResultsFrom
        the oncological database of rectal cancer patients treated from 2003 till
        2012 ( n \_=\_317) a cohort of 153 patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria
        was identified. Rectal cancer resection was performed by laparoscopy in 53
        patients (34.6\_%) and by laparotomy in 100 patients (65.4\_%). A total of
        17 IH (11.1\_%) was diagnosed at the former stoma site after a mean follow-up

        (15.1\_%) and 9 IH in patients who had an open LAR (9.0\_%) (Fisher\u2019s

        microscopic examination of stained thick and thin blood smears for malaria
        can differentiate clinically relevant asexual parasitemia from clinically
        irrelevant isolated gametocytemia. Microscopy is time consuming, labour intensive,
        and requires significant technical expertise to perform. Simple and rapid
        tests that can distinguish asexual from isolated sexual parasitemia are needed.MethodsTo
        determine if parasitemia and cycle threshold (C_T) values on Plasmodium genus
        and P. falciparum -specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
        assays correlate to positivity of rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and 18S rRNA
        gene copy number, we analyzed blood samples from Ontario patients with isolated
        P. falciparum gametocytemia or asexual stages. RNA transcripts were evaluated
        to determine whether there is correlation of expression to different life
        cycle stages of P. falciparum .Results45 specimens containing isolated P.
        falciparum gametocytes, and 40 specimens containing isolated asexual stages
        by microscopy were identified and analyzed. By RDT, 40 of 45 (88.9\_%) isolated
        gametocytemia specimens and 40 of 40 (100\_%) asexual-stage specimens were
        positive for Plasmodium falciparum -specific histidine rich protein-2 (HRP-2).
        Fourteen of 45 (31.1\_%) isolated gametocytemia specimens, and 36 of 40 (90\_%)
        asexual-stage specimens were positive for Plasmodium genus aldolase T2 band.
        Positivity of the aldolase T2 band was associated with lower mean Plasmodium
        genus and P. falciparum- specific C_T values, and to higher mean 18S rRNA
        gene copy by qPCR for both isolated gametocytemia and asexual-stage specimens.
        There was also a negative correlation of asexual parasitemia to both C_T values,
        and positive correlation to 18S rRNA gene copy number. Analysis of asexual
        stage-specific erythrocyte binding antigen (eba-175) transcripts on 25 isolated
        gametocytemia and 20 asexual-stage specimens gave a positive predictive value
        of 62.5\_% and negative predictive value of 100\_% for asexual parasitemia.
        Thus, an absence of eba-175 transcripts excluded the presence of asexual (clinically
        relevant) parasitemia.ConclusionsPositivity of the aldolase T2 band of BinaxNow
        RDT correlated to higher parasite load in both isolated gametocytemia and
        asexual-stage specimens. Asexual stage-specific eba-175 RNA transcript expression
        provided reasonable negative predictive value for exclusion of asexual parasitemia
        in clinical samples, but was present in both isolated gametocytemia and asexual

        using different temperatures ranging from 38 to 42\_\xB0C combined with cisplatin

        treated with either cisplatin or doxorubicin was further improved only at

        were reached after 10\_min in the peritoneal cavity. A temperature above 40\_\xB0C

        In order to test if endogenous trehalose (i.e., synthesized by the cell) could

        structures are present in many modern and natural materials and their proper
        utilization is crucial within many industries. Characterizing their structural
        and mechanical properties is complicated, in that they often have a stochastic
        cellular structure, and in addition, they often have hyper-elastic (i.e.,
        non-linear) mechanical properties. Understanding the 3D structure and the
        dynamic response of polymer foams to mechanical stress is a key to predicting
        lifetime performance, damage pathways, and stress recovery. Therefore, to
        gain a more complete picture, experiments which are designed to understand
        their mechanical properties must simultaneously acquire performance metrics
        during loading. In situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography can image these
        cellular materials in 3D during uniaxial compression at a 10^\u22122\_s^\u22121
        strain rate. By utilizing the high X-ray photon flux and high-speed camera
        provided by beamline 2-BM at the advanced photon source, it is possible to
        collect a full 3D tomogram (900 radiographs as the sample is rotated 180\xB0)
        within 1\_s. Rotating the sample stage in a washing machine motion allows
        for a 1\_s tomogram to be collected every fifth second. In this study, a series
        of 20 tomograms were collected as the sample was continuously stressed to
        a nominal 60\_% compression. Several types of silicone foams with various
        structures were used to explore this technique. Stress\u2013strain curves,
        collected simultaneously with the 3D tomograms, can be used to directly correlate
        the morphology with the mechanical performance and visualize in real-time,
        the buckling of ligaments. In addition, this method allows for the accurate
        measurement of the Poisson\u2019s ratio as a function of compression. Coupling
        this moderate strain rate 3D data with finite element analysis provides a

        bromide (MTT) assay. The levels of nitric oxide production by AMs exposed
        to these AmB-lipid formulations were determined by the Griess reaction. Phagocytosis
        of the AmB-lipid formulations was carried out using AM cells. The lipid bilayer
        membranes and AmB-lipid formulations were successfully prepared. In vitro
        cytotoxicity results showed less toxicity to kidney cells than pure AmB, and
        a 1,000-fold less production of nitric oxide by NR8383 cell lines was obtained
        when compared to lipopolysaccharide. Permeation results were two- to fivefold
        higher than for pure AmB in the ergosterol containing lipid bilayer and two-
        to fourfold higher than AmB in the cholesterol containing compositions, both
        of which were enough to kill the fungi according to their MICs and MFCs. AM
        phagocytosed the AmB-lipid formulations. We suggest that these products especially
        the AmB-sodium deoxycholate sulfate are potential candidates for targeting
        AM cells for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10298-015-0984-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10298-015-0984-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10298-015-0984-5\"}],\"title\":\"Fibromyalgie\",\"creators\":[{\"creator\":\"Goetz,

        In this study, the antibacterial effect of five extracts from W. indica on

        measured by microcalorimetry. According to the principal component analysis,
        k _1, k _2, and P _1 were obtained from heat flow power\u2013time (HFP\u2013time)

        scales may be used as nonlethal alternative structures to otoliths for establishing
        chemical time-series that trace migration and habitat use for euryhaline species
        such as Atlantic tarpon ( Megalops atlanticus ). We survey four decades of
        fish scale studies employing elemental analyses to show the wide diversity
        of aims, approaches and instrumentation. Analyses are mainly solution-based
        measurements of whole or subsampled scales or in situ solid-sampling techniques
        of specific growth regions. Although spot-based transects across scales have
        been employed for a handful of species, continuous elemental transects across
        scale growth increments are rare. Laser ablation based sampling methods that
        assay scale exteriors can be difficult to implement for species with natural
        topographic variations exceeding the focal range of the laser. These limitations
        may be overcome by performing laser ablation of scales in cross-section when
        scale thickness in the well-calcified external layer provides enough surface
        area for a laser transect. For this study, scales of Atlantic tarpon were
        embedded in epoxy and longitudinally cross-sectioned to expose the scale growth
        record of the external layer. Laser ablation ICP-MS was used to quantify continuous
        profiles of element:Ca ratios across scale growth increments. The analytes
        surveyed (Mg, P, Ca, Mn, Sr, and Ba) were consistently above the limits of
        detection (LODs) across each scale with the exception of Pb for one scale.
        Obtaining high resolution elemental life history profiles from scales will
        be essential for future efforts to use this structure as a non-lethal substitute
        for otoliths in Atlantic tarpon and other migratory fishes that possess scales
        with sufficiently thick calcified external layers to permit a cross-sectional

        (DNS) of turbulent combustion is a research area becoming ever more important
        and has been established as a powerful tool in combustion science to complement
        theory and experiment. The rapid advancement of supercomputing has lately
        enabled a series of interesting DNS studies with some practical relevance.
        This advent along with the severe lack of experimental data sets with a high
        degree of data completeness motivates the use of DNS for combustion modeling.
        Simultaneously, enormous progress is made in the utilization of DNS data as
        a valuable resource to develop and validate combustion models from DNS data.
        In this paper, several promising and useful analysis techniques are identified
        and reviewed. Their usefulness is demonstrated on the basis of selected modeling
        studies, which comprise examples of various commonly employed modeling frameworks,
        and which integrate DNS in a systematic way into the process of model development
        and validation. It is expected that the modeling routes outlined here can
        be used to address currently open modeling questions and to advance the fidelity

        therapy (NT) is increasingly utilized for the treatment of pancreatic ductal

        the use of additional postoperative therapy following NT. The lymph node ratio
        (LNR) is a prognostic marker of oncologic outcomes after NT and resection.
        In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of postoperative therapy following
        NT, stratified by LNR.MethodsA prospective tumor registry database was queried
        to identify patients with PDAC who underwent resection following NT from 1990
        to 2008. Clinicopathologic factors were compared to identify associations
        with overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) based on postoperative
        chemotherapy status.ResultsThirty-six (14\_%) of the 263 patients received
        additional postoperative therapy. No differences were observed in the pathologic
        characteristics between patients who received postoperative chemotherapy and
        those who did not. The median LNR was 0.12 for patients with N\_+\_disease.
        Following NT, the administration of postoperative therapy was associated with
        improved median OS (72 vs. 33\_months; p \_=\_0.008) for patients with an

        underwent riboflavin/UVA cross-linking prior to being trephined and sutured
        to untreated hosts. In the conventional keratoplasty group, both host and

        tests are often called punch penetration tests and are known to be related
        to penetration rates of drilling equipment and hard rock tunnel boring machines
        (TBMs). Various indices determined from analysis of the force-penetration
        plot generated from indentation tests have been used to represent the drillability,
        boreability, and brittleness of rocks. However, no standard for the punch
        penetration test procedure or method for calculating the related indices has
        been suggested or adopted in the rock mechanics community. This paper introduces
        new indices based on the punch test to predict the performance of hard rock
        TBMs. A series of punch tests was performed on rock specimens representing
        six rock formations in Korea with different dimensions, i.e., the core specimens
        had different lengths and diameters. Of the indices obtained from the punch
        tests, the peak load index and mean load index showed good correlations with
        the cutting forces measured in full-scale linear cutting machine tests on
        the same rock types. The indices also showed good linear correlations with
        the ratio of uniaxial strength to Brazilian tensile strength, which indicates
        the brittleness of rock. The scale effect of using core specimens was investigated,
        and a preferred dimension for the punch test specimens is proposed. This paper
        also discusses the results of the punch test and full-scale rock cutting tests
        using LCM. The results of this study confirm that the proposed indices from
        the punch tests can be used to provide a reliable prediction of the cutting
        forces that act on a disc cutter. The estimated cutting forces can then be
        used for optimization of cutter-head design and performance prediction of

        was to examine the contamination, accumulation, and distribution of mercury
        in fruiting bodies by Leccinum versipelle fungus collected from distant sites
        across Poland. Mercury was determined using validated method by cold-vapor
        atomic absorption spectroscopy after direct sample matrix combustion. A large
        set of data gained using 371 fruiting bodies and 204 soil samples revealed
        the susceptibility of L. versipelle to Hg contamination and permitted the
        estimation of probable intake of Hg contaminant by consumers foraging for
        this species. The range of median values of Hg determined in caps of L. versipelle
        was from 0.20 to 2.0\_mg\_kg^\u22121 dry biomass, and the median for 19 localities
        was 0.65\_mg\_kg^\u22121 dry biomass. The values of the Hg bioconcentration
        factor (BCF) determined for L. versipelle correlated negatively with Hg contents.
        Mercury in topsoil beneath L. versipelle ranged from 0.019 to 0.041\_mg\_kg^\u22121
        dry matter for less-contaminated locations (BCF of 17 to 65 for caps) and
        from 0.076 to 0.39\_mg\_kg^\u22121 dry matter for more contaminated locations
        (BCF of 1.9 to 22). Fruiting bodies of L. versipelle collected in some regions
        of Poland if consumed in amount of 300\_g in one meal in a week could provide
        Hg doses above the provisionally tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) value of 0.004\_mg
        Hg\_kg^\u22121 body mass, while regular consumptions for most of the locations

        a total of 200 women with primary infertility undergoing embryo transfer were
        analyzed. Transvaginal ultrasonography was done on the 10th day of the menstrual
        cycle. To assess the uterine receptivity, we analyzed all the ultrasonographic
        and Doppler parameters. The slightly modified version of Applebaum Uterine
        Scoring System was used. This uterine scoring system included all the following
        parameters: endometrial thickness, endometrial morphology, endometrial blood
        flow within zone 3, myometrial echogenecity, uterine artery pulsatility index
        (PI), end diastolic blood flow, and myometrial blood flow internal to the
        arcuate vessels seen on gray-scale examination.ResultsThe pregnancy rates
        were higher in women with thick, distinct five-line endometrium and multifocal
        endometrial vascularity within zone 3. Absent endometrial flow, despite highest
        values for the other parameters, was associated with no conception. In our
        study, no pregnancy occurred with uterine PI values of more than 2.8. Absence
        or reversal of end diastolic blood flow was associated with no conception.
        A maximum score of 20 was associated with the pregnancy rate of 97.4\_%, whereas
        scores of 13 or less resulted in no pregnancies.ConclusionUterine scoring

        the native woodlands of Europe, including those of Britain and Ireland, have
        increasingly come under threat from a range of biotic and abiotic factors,
        and are therefore a conservation priority demanding careful management in
        order to realise their inherent ecological and cultural benefits. Because
        the distribution of genetic variation across populations and regions is increasingly
        considered an important component of woodland management, we carried out a
        population genetic analysis on black alder ( Alnus glutinosa ) across Northern
        Ireland in order to inform \u201Cbest practice\u201D strategies. Our findings
        suggest that populations harbour high levels of genetic diversity, with very
        little differentiation between populations. Significant F _IS values were
        observed in over half of the populations analysed, however, which could reflect
        inbreeding as a result of the patchy occurrence of alder in Northern Ireland,
        with scattered, favourable damp habitats being largely isolated from each
        other by extensive tracts of farmland. Although there is no genetic evidence
        to support the broad-scale implementation of tree seed zones along the lines
        of those proposed for native woodlands in Great Britain, we suggest that the
        localised occurrence of rare chloroplast haplotypes should be taken into account
        on a case-by-case basis. This, coupled with the identification of populations
        containing high genetic diversity and that are broadly representative of the
        region as a whole, will provide a sound genetic basis for woodland management,
        both in alder and more generally for species that exhibit low levels of genetic

        A. mellifera workers in apiaries enter foreign colonies accidentally, do they
        continue to refrain from laying eggs in the foreign colony, or do they behave
        in their evolutionary interests and attempt to lay eggs? We propose two hypotheses:

        as a crucial task of business process management, has been widely acknowledged
        by its importance for process performance improvement. Although some methods
        have been proposed to support resource allocation, there is little effort
        to allocate resources from the task preference perspective. This paper proposes
        a novel mechanism in which resource allocation is considered as a multi-criteria
        decision problem and solved by a new entropy-based clustering ensemble approach.
        By mining resource characteristics and task preference patterns from past
        process executions, the \u201Cright\u201D resources could be recommended to
        improve resource utility. Further, to support dynamic resource allocation
        in the context of multiple process instances running concurrently, a heuristic
        method is devised to deal with resource conflicts caused by the interplay
        between various instances. The effectiveness of this study is evaluated with

        microalgae produce triacylglycerol (TAG) under stress conditions such as nitrogen
        depletion, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this
        study, we focused on the role of target of rapamycin (TOR) in TAG accumulation.
        TOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is highly conserved and plays
        pivotal roles in nitrogen and other signaling pathways in eukaryotes. We previously
        constructed a rapamycin-susceptible Cyanidioschyzon merolae , a unicellular
        red alga, by expressing yeast FKBP12 protein to evaluate the results of TOR
        inhibition (Imamura et al. in Biochem Biophys Res Commun 439:264\u2013269,
        2013 ). By using this strain, we here report that rapamycin-induced TOR inhibition
        results in accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets containing TAG. Transcripts
        for TAG synthesis-related genes, such as glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase
        and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), were increased by rapamycin
        treatment. We also found that fatty acid synthase-dependent de novo fatty
        acid synthesis was required for the accumulation of lipid droplets. Induction
        of TAG and up-regulation of DGAT gene expression by rapamycin were similarly
        observed in the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . These
        results suggest the general involvement of TOR signaling in TAG accumulation
        in divergent microalgae.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s40688-015-0071-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40688-015-0071-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40688-015-0071-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40688-015-0071-9\"}],\"title\":\"The

        educational involvement during middle school has received increased attention
        from researchers and policymakers because of its links to a variety of academic
        outcomes. Despite this increased attention, parental involvement has been
        inconsistently linked to academic outcomes among adolescents, indicating different
        types and levels of involvement that may be more beneficial for adolescents.
        Therefore, this study examined the nonlinear associations between parental
        involvement (home-based involvement and academic socialization) and academic
        motivation in an effort to better understand the nature of parental involvement
        in middle school. Using data from an ethnically diverse (57\_% Black/African

        and 1\_% Asian American) sample of 150 adolescents (56\_% female) in grades
        6 through 8, findings showed no associations between home-based involvement
        and intrinsic or extrinsic motivation. There was, however, a significant nonlinear
        association between academic socialization and both types of motivation. More
        specifically, the positive association between academic socialization and
        intrinsic motivation was attenuated at high levels of academic socialization.
        There was no association between academic socialization and extrinsic motivation
        at low and moderate levels, but there was a positive association at high levels

        included 64 consecutive patients with CT-ESCC who underwent surgery. All patients
        were divided into two groups based on the location of the epicenter or anal

        were classified as having cervical-centered and thoracic-centered tumors,
        respectively; while, using the height of the anal edge, 38 and 26 patients

        fibrosis is a public health problem worldwide. There is a need of noninvasive

        study, we aim to evaluate the potential of T1\u03C1 MRI technique in detecting
        and characterizing different grades of liver fibrosis in vivo in humans.MethodsHealthy
        subjects and patients with liver fibrosis were prospectively recruited for
        T1\u03C1 MRI of liver on a 1.5\_T MR scanner. Single slice T1\u03C1 weighted
        images were acquired at different spin lock duration (0, 10, 20 and 30\_ms)
        with spin lock amplitude of 500\_Hz in a single breath-hold. Additionally,
        liver\u2019s T1\u03C1 images were acquired from five healthy subjects on the
        same day (n\_=\_2) and different day (n\_=\_2) sessions for test\u2013retest
        study. Liver biopsy samples from patients were obtained and used to calculate
        the METAVIR score to define the stage of fibrosis and inflammation grade.
        T1\u03C1 maps were generated followed by computation of mean and standard
        deviation (SD) values. Coefficient of variation (COV) of T1\u03C1 values between
        two MRI scans was computed to determine reproducibility in liver. T test was
        used to compare T1\u03C1 values between healthy and fibrotic liver. Pearson
        correlation was performed between stages of liver fibrosis and T1\u03C1 values.ResultsThe
        mean (SD) T1\u03C1 value among subject with healthy liver was 51.04 (3.06)
        ms. The COV of T1\u03C1 values between two repetitions in the same day session
        was 0.83\_\xB1\_0.8\_% and in different day session was 5.4\_\xB1\_2.7\_%.
        T1\u03C1 values in fibrotic liver were significantly higher compared to those
        of healthy liver (p\_\\u003c\_0.05). A statically significant correlation
        between stages of fibrosis and T1\u03C1 values was observed (r\_=\_0.99, p\_\\u003c\_0.05).
        Inflammation score for one patient was 2 and for remaining patients it was
        1.ConclusionsProposed T1\u03C1 pulse sequence design and protocol enabled
        acquisition of a single slice T1\u03C1 weighted images in a single breath-hold
        and hence mitigated breathing motion related artifacts. Preliminary results
        have shown the sensitivity of T1\u03C1 values to changes induced by liver
        fibrosis, and may potentially be used as a clinical biomarker to delineate
        the stages of liver fibrosis. Further, studies on a large number of subjects
        are required to validate the observations of the current study. Nevertheless,
        T1\u03C1 imaging can be easily setup on a clinical scanner to monitor the
        progression of liver fibrosis and to the evaluate efficacy of anti-fibrotic
        drugs.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11664-015-4007-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11664-015-4007-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11664-015-4007-y\"}],\"title\":\"Visible

        paper investigates the relationship between trading volume and volatility
        for four international stock markets (US: S\\u0026P500, UK: FTSE100, France:
        CAC40 and Germany: DAX30) in a context of global financial crisis. Unlike
        previous related studies, we use intraday data and apply a nonlinear econometric
        model to assess this relationship. In particular, we first break down intraday
        realized volatility into its continuous and jump components using the non-parametric
        approach developed by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (J Financ Econom 4:1\u201330,
        2006 ). Second, we investigate the volume\u2013volatility relationship and
        test whether it varies according to volatility components (jumps and continuous
        component). While Giot et al. (J Empir Finance 17:168\u2013175, 2010 ), among
        others, investigated the volume\u2013volatility relationship in a linear context,
        our study contributes by estimating different nonlinear specifications (threshold
        model, nonlinear Tobit model) that enable us to capture further asymmetry
        and time-variation to better apprehend the effect of trading volume on realized
        volatility. Accordingly, our study yields two interesting findings. On the
        one hand, as expected there is a significant and positive relationship between
        trading volume and realized volatility, as well as with its components, confirming
        the importance of trading volume as a key to characterizing volatility. On
        the other hand, we show that this relationship exhibits asymmetry and nonlinearity,
        and that threshold models are more appropriate than linear model to characterize
        the volume volatility relationship.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00362-015-0712-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00362-015-0712-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00362-015-0712-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00362-015-0712-0\"}],\"title\":\"Testing

        calcium (iCa) concentration is often used in critical care and measured using
        blood gas analyzers at the point of care. Controlling and adjusting regional
        citrate anticoagulation (RCA) for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)
        involves measuring the iCa concentration in two samples: systemic with physiological
        iCa concentrations and post filter samples with very low iCa concentrations.
        However, modern blood gas analyzers are optimized for physiological iCa concentrations
        which might make them less suitable for measuring low iCa in blood with a
        high concentration of citrate. We present results of iCa measurements from
        six different blood gas analyzers and the impact on clinical decisions based
        on the recommendations of the dialysis\u2019 device manufacturer.MethodThe
        iCa concentrations of systemic and post filter samples were measured using
        six distinct, frequently used blood gas analyzers. We obtained iCa results
        of 74 systemic and 84 post filter samples from patients undergoing RCA for
        CRRT at the University Medicine of Greifswald.ResultsThe systemic samples
        showed concordant results on all analyzers with median iCa concentrations
        ranging from 1.07 to 1.16\_mmol/L. The medians of iCa concentrations for post
        filter samples ranged from 0.21 to 0.50\_mmol/L. Results of \\u003e70\_% of
        the post filter samples would lead to major differences in decisions regarding
        citrate flow depending on the instrument used.ConclusionMeasurements of iCa
        in post filter samples may give misleading information in monitoring the RCA.
        Recommendations of the dialysis manufacturer need to be revised. Meanwhile,
        little weight should be given to post filter iCa. Reference methods for low
        iCa in whole blood containing citrate should be established.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10021-015-9912-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10021-015-9912-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10021-015-9912-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-015-9912-7\"}],\"title\":\"Differences

        the boreal forest of Alaska, increased fire severity associated with climate
        change is expanding deciduous forest cover in areas previously dominated by
        black spruce ( Picea mariana ). Needle-leaf conifer and broad-leaf deciduous
        species are commonly associated with differences in tree growth, carbon (C)
        and nutrient cycling, and C accumulation in soils. Although this suggests
        that changes in tree species composition in Alaska could impact C and nutrient
        pools and fluxes, few studies have measured these linkages. We quantified
        C, nitrogen, phosphorus, and base cation pools and fluxes in three stands
        of black spruce and Alaska paper birch ( Betula neoalaskana ) that established
        following a single fire event in 1958. Paper birch consistently displayed
        characteristics of more rapid C and nutrient cycling, including greater aboveground
        net primary productivity, higher live foliage and litter nutrient concentrations,
        and larger ammonium and nitrate pools in the soil organic layer (SOL). Ecosystem
        C stocks (aboveground\_+\_SOL\_+\_0\u201310\_cm mineral soil) were similar
        for the two species; however, in black spruce, 78% of measured C was found
        in soil pools, primarily in the SOL, whereas aboveground biomass dominated
        ecosystem C pools in birch forest. Radiocarbon analysis indicated that approximately
        one-quarter of the black spruce SOL C accumulated prior to the 1958 fire,
        whereas no pre-fire C was observed in birch soils. Our findings suggest that
        tree species exert a strong influence over C and nutrient cycling in boreal
        forest and forest compositional shifts may have long-term implications for
        ecosystem C and nutrient dynamics.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00289-015-1526-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00289-015-1526-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00289-015-1526-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00289-015-1526-x\"}],\"title\":\"Effect

        limb perfusion (ILP) is indicated in locally advanced melanoma and soft tissue
        sarcoma of the extremities. This series reports the outcome of patients undergoing
        ILP with melphalan and tumour necrosis factor \u03B1 (TNF\u03B1) at a single
        centre.MethodsAll patients undergoing ILP from January 2005 to January 2015
        were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Those undergoing
        ILP for in-transit melanoma (ITM) were grouped according to disease burden:
        low volume and bulky (\\u003e2\_cm diameter).ResultsA total of 143 perfusions
        were attempted: 9 and 134 in the upper and lower limbs, respectively. A response
        was assessable in 129 patients with overall response rates for ITM and sarcoma
        of 81.8 and 61.1\_%, respectively. No difference was found in response rates
        between low-volume and bulky ITM. Limb salvage rates in these cohorts were
        97 and 62\_%. Regional toxicity following ILP was minimal with 7 grade III
        (5.4\_%), and 1 grade V (0.8\_%) reactions. Median progression-free survival
        was 11\_months in the ITM cohort and 12\_months in the sarcoma cohort. In
        the ITM cohort, complete responses were significantly more durable than partial
        responses ( p \_=\_0.0004). Median disease-specific survival was 21\_months
        in the ITM cohort and was not reached in the sarcoma cohort.ConclusionsTNF\u03B1-based
        ILP is safe and provides excellent palliation of ITM due to rapid progression
        of systemic disease. It is less effective in sarcoma due to lower initial
        response rates and a lower incidence of disease dissemination.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00296-015-3357-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00296-015-3357-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00296-015-3357-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00296-015-3357-3\"}],\"title\":\"Variation

        is frequently claimed that fatigue reflects pain and that strategies for alleviating
        fatigue in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) should focus on pain
        management. The aim of this study was twofold: to investigate the correlation
        between fatigue and pain over time and to investigate the temporal relationship
        between fatigue and pain in patients with AS. Fatigue and pain were assessed
        twice a week for 35\_weeks in 23 patients with AS. Data were reported with
        text messages on mobile phones, constituting around 70 repeated measurements
        per patient. To estimate correlation over time, the correlation coefficient
        within individuals was estimated. When estimating the temporal relationship,
        we lagged the independent variable and performed individual linear regression.
        In 16 (70\_%) of the patients, \u226436\_% of the variance in fatigue was
        explained by pain. The association between fatigue and pain was synchronous
        in time in 13 (57\_%) patients, while 5 (22\_%) patients reported that fatigue
        precedes pain by 1\_week and 5 (22\_%) that pain precedes fatigue by 1\_week.
        Fatigue and pain may be two separate and independent symptoms in some patients
        with AS. The clinical implication is that the two symptoms should be targeted
        separately because it cannot always be expected that an improvement in one
        is followed by an improvement in the other.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12274-015-0837-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12274-015-0837-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12274-015-0837-4\"}],\"title\":\"Coherent

        traits and can be improved efficiently by genomic selection modeling main
        and epistatic effects.AbstractEnhancing the resistance against Fusarium head
        blight (FHB) and Septoria tritici blotch (STB) is of central importance for
        a sustainable wheat production. Our study is based on a large experimental
        data set of 2325 inbred lines genotyped with 12,642 SNP markers and phenotyped
        in multi-environmental trials for FHB and STB resistance as well as for plant
        height. Our objectives were to (1) investigate the impact of plant height
        on FHB and STB severity, (2) examine the potential of marker-assisted selection,
        and (3) study the prediction ability of genomic selection modeling main and
        epistatic effects. We observed low correlations between plant height and FHB
        ( r \_=\_\u22120.15; P \_\\u003c\_0.05) as well as STB severity ( r \_=\_\u22120.17;
        P \_\\u003c\_0.05) suggesting negligible morphological resistances. Cross-validation
        in combination with association mapping revealed absence of large effect QTL
        impeding an efficient pyramiding of different resistance loci through marker-assisted
        selection. The prediction ability of genomic selection was high amounting
        to 0.6 for FHB and 0.5 for STB resistance. Therefore, genomic selection is
        a promising tool to improve FHB and STB resistance in wheat.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11837-015-1626-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11837-015-1626-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11837-015-1626-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11837-015-1626-y\"}],\"title\":\"The

        evidence that tobacco control mass media campaigns can change smoking behaviour.
        In the UK, campaigns over the last decade have contributed to declines in
        smoking prevalence and been associated with falls in cigarette consumption
        among continuing smokers. However, it is less evident whether such campaigns
        can also play a role in changing smokers\u2019 behaviour in relation to protecting
        others from the harmful effects of their smoking in the home. We investigated
        whether exposure to English televised tobacco control campaigns, and specifically
        campaigns targeting second hand smoking, is associated with smokers having
        a smoke-free home.MethodsWe used repeated cross-sectional national survey
        data on 9872 households which participated in the Health Survey for England
        between 2004 and 2010, with at least one adult current smoker living in the
        household. Exposure to all government-funded televised tobacco control campaigns,
        and to those specifically with a second hand smoking theme, was quantified
        in Gross Rating Points (GRPs), an average per capita measure of advert exposure
        where 100 GRPs indicates 100\_% of adults exposed once or 50\_% twice. Our
        outcome was self-reported presence of a smoke-free home (where no one smokes
        in the home on most days). Analysis used generalised additive models, controlling
        for individual factors and temporal trends.ResultsThere was no association
        between monthly televised campaigns overall and the probability of having
        a smoke-free home. However, exposure to campaigns specifically targeting second
        hand smoke was associated with increased odds of a smoke-free home in the
        following month (odds ratio per additional 100 GRPs, 1.07, 95\_% CI 1.01 to
        1.13), though this association was not seen at other lags. These effects were
        not modified by socio-economic status or by presence of a child in the home.ConclusionsOur
        findings provide tentative evidence that mass media campaigns specifically
        focussing on second hand smoke may be effective in reducing smoking in the
        home, and further evaluation of campaigns of this type is needed. General
        tobacco control campaigns in England, which largely focus on promoting smoking
        cessation, do not impact on smoke-free homes over and above their direct effect
        at reducing smoking.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00018-015-2030-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00018-015-2030-z\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00018-015-2030-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-015-2030-z\"}],\"title\":\"The

        a complex process through which spermatogonial stem cells undergo mitosis,
        meiosis, and cell differentiation to generate mature spermatozoa. During this
        process, male germ cells experience several translational modifications. One
        of the major post-translational modifications in eukaryotes is the ubiquitination
        of proteins, which targets proteins for degradation; this enables control
        of the expression of enzymes and structural proteins during spermatogenesis.
        It has become apparent that ubiquitination plays a key role in regulating
        every stage of spermatogenesis starting from gonocytes to differentiated spermatids.
        It is understood that, where there is ubiquitination, deubiquitination by
        deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) also exists to counterbalance the ubiquitination
        process in a reversible manner. Normal spermatogenesis is dependent on the
        balanced actions of ubiquitination and deubiquitination. This review highlights
        the current knowledge of the role of DUBs and their essential regulatory contribution

        lymphoma (HL) is characterized by the presence of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg
        cells. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is thought to play an important
        role in the development of HL. Although epigenetic alterations, such as aberrant
        DNA methylation, are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of various malignancies,
        little is known about such alterations in HL and their putative relationships
        with EBV infection.MethodsWe investigated promoter methylation patterns of
        seven tumor-associated genes in 53 primary HL cases using methylation-specific
        PCR (MS-PCR). Concomitantly, the EBV infection status was assessed using PCR,
        in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.ResultsThe gene promoter hypermethylation
        frequencies observed were 77.3\_% for P16 , 58.5\_% for RASSF1A , 50.9\_%
        for CDH1 , 45.3\_% for DAPK , 43.4\_% for GSTP1 , 37.7\_% for SHP1 and 24.3\_%

        Interestingly, most of the analyzed gene promoters were more frequently hypermethylated
        in EBV-negative than in EBV-positive cases, in particular the DAPK gene promoter
        (58\_% versus 27\_%, p \_=\_0.04). Furthermore, hypermethylation of multiple
        gene promoters (\u2265 3) was encountered more frequently in females than

        and EBV-negative HL. The rates of these changes were found to vary according

        is known that there is a significant amount of thermal energy used for the
        sugar cane industry for the purpose of power production and for use in the
        sugar or ethanol processing in cane sugar industries. Likewise, it is understood
        that there are substantial amounts of waste heat that is not being recovered,
        in particular for traditional sugar mills. Regardless of this, energy conservation
        is given less consideration as compared to operational convenience due to
        the fact that sugar mills are self-sufficient in energy (heat and power).
        The identification of such potential heat loss areas (especially during transient
        conditions) suggests the sugar mills play a vital role in energy saving. In
        this study, a modified setup of the base case plant considered in part I of
        this paper is assessed for its energy potential and possible major heat losses
        during steady state and transient conditions where 2-h stoppage of the mill
        presses are considered to occur. For the modified setup, there are two major
        scenarios considered having two sub-scenarios each. The result of the assessment
        showed that the steady state assumption scenario of the modified plant (where
        bagasse drying is not considered) indicated a 20\_% reduction in the losses
        considered which resulted in a 57\_% power generation increase as compared
        to the steady state model of the base case plant. It is also possible to save
        excess bagasse by drying the bagasse for later use during unexpected stoppage.
        The carbon dioxide emission (amounting 29\_t/day in case 2a of this study)
        that occurs during the use of fuel oil during such stoppages will thus be
        avoided. The simple economic analysis showed that it is only in case 2a where
        fuel oil cost is included in the operation cost that resulted in a negative
        NPV. Since the rest of the scenarios use bagasse as a fuel which is free,
        the NPV for all was positive. For the electricity price of 0.04 US $/kWh and
        discount rate of 15\_%, the minimum payback period attained is about 3\_years
        (case 1b) where the bagasse moisture content is 30\_% whereas the maximum
        payback period is 6\_years (case 1a) where there is no bagasse drying considered.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00542-015-2672-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00542-015-2672-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00542-015-2672-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00542-015-2672-7\"}],\"title\":\"Effects

        Pearson correlation, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted
        to analyze the data. The current study found that there exist a medium correlation
        between PF and both peer relations and self-esteem individually. Moreover,
        after conducting SEM, the proposed model on children\u2019s PF development

        negative self-esteem or are classified into social rejected groups, the results
        clarified that if children\u2019s PF is stepped up, their peer relations are
        able to be reformed and self-esteem could be mended. The current study suggested
        that children should regularly participate in exercises, because PF could
        improve development of peer relations and self-esteem. In addition, PF instructors
        might provide suitable levels or gradually advance fitness intensity to participants

        is a risk factor for intimal hyperplasia (IH). Key to IH is vascular smooth
        muscle cell (VSMC) migration. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a matricellular
        protein that stimulates VSMC migration. Hypothesis: HDL will inhibit and LDL
        will augment TSP-1-induced VSMC chemotaxis. VSMC chemotaxis will be inhibited
        by the HDL moiety, S1P, through the S1PR1 receptor, and augmented by the LDL
        component, LPA, through the LPAR1 receptor. The goal of this study was to
        determine the effect of HDL and LDL and their receptors on TSP-1-induced VSMC
        chemotaxis. For VSMC chemotaxis to TSP-1 cells received the following pretreatments:
        low (25\_\xB5g/ml) or optimal (75\_\xB5g/ml) concentration of HDL, S1P, optimal
        (75\_\xB5g/ml) or high (175\_\xB5g/ml) concentration of LDL, or LPA. For the
        receptor studies, VSMCs were transfected with siRNA to S1PR1, S1PR3, LPAR1,
        LPAR2, LPAR3, or a S1PR2 receptor antagonist. The TSP-1-induced chemotaxis
        results were (1) HDL (25\_\xB5g/ml) or LDL (75\_\xB5g/ml) exhibited no effect
        on chemotaxis; (2) HDL (75\_\xB5g/ml) inhibited chemotaxis by 50.9\_\xB1\_8\_%
        and S1P by 43.4\_\xB1\_11.6\_%; (3) LDL (175\_\xB5g/ml) augmented chemotaxis
        by 30\_\xB1\_10.4\_% and LPA by 25.6\_\xB1\_12.3\_%; (4) S1PR1 and S1PR3 knockdown
        and S1PR2 antagonist-treated cells augmented chemotaxis; and (5) LPAR1 and
        LPAR2 knockdown inhibited and LPAR3 knockdown had no effect on chemotaxis.
        In conclusion, HDL/S1P inhibits, while LDL/LPA stimulates TSP-1-induced VSMC
        chemotaxis. The HDL/S1P effect is mediated by the S1PR1-3 receptors. The LDL/LPA
        effects are mediated by the LPAR1 and LPAR2 receptors, but not LPAR3. Therefore,
        lipids have significant effects on TSP-1-induced VSMC chemotaxis.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11277-015-3057-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11277-015-3057-z\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11277-015-3057-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-015-3057-z\"}],\"title\":\"A

        common recognition of joint responsibility for global health by all countries
        particularly to ensure justice in global health, current discussions of countries\u2019
        obligations for global health largely ignore obligations of developing countries.
        This is especially the case with regards to obligations relating to health
        financing. Bearing in mind that it is not possible to achieve justice in global
        health without achieving equity in health financing at both domestic and global
        levels, our aim is to show how fulfilling the obligation we propose will make
        it easy to achieve equity in health financing at both domestic and international
        levels.DiscussionAchieving equity in global health financing is a crucial
        step towards achieving justice in global health. Our general view is that
        current discussions on global health equity largely ignore obligations of
        Low Income Country (LIC) governments and we recommend that these obligations
        should be mainstreamed in current discussions. While we recognise that various
        obligations need to be fulfilled in order to ultimately achieve justice in
        global health, for lack of space we prioritise obligations for health financing.
        Basing on the evidence that in most LICs health is not given priority in annual
        budget allocations, we propose that LIC governments should bear an obligation
        to allocate a certain minimum percent of their annual domestic budget resources
        to health, while they await external resources to supplement domestic ones.
        We recommend and demonstrate a mechanism for coordinating this obligation
        so that if the resulting obligations are fulfilled by both LIC and HIC governments
        it will be easy to achieve equity in global health financing.SummaryAlthough
        achieving justice in global health will depend on fulfilment of different
        categories of obligations, ensuring inter- and intra-country equity in health
        financing is pivotal. This can be achieved by requiring all LIC governments
        to allocate a certain optimal per cent of their domestic budget resources
        to health while they await external resources to top up in order to cover
        the whole cost of the minimum health opportunities for LIC citizens.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12595-015-0158-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12595-015-0158-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12595-015-0158-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12595-015-0158-3\"}],\"title\":\"Occurrence

        (protozoan and/or helminth and/or pentastomid) stage, of which 180 (29.9\_%,
        95\_% CI 26.3\u201333.7) and 129 (21.9\_%, 95\_% CI 18.2\u201324.9) tested
        positive for protozoan or nematode endoparasites, respectively. Fecal forms
        of at least 14 endoparasites were identified. The most frequently identified
        stages were those of Giardia (26.4\_%), Trichuris (9.5\_%), Toxocara (8.0\_%),
        hookworms (7.1\_%), Cystoisospora ohioensis (4.3\_%), and Cystoisospora canis
        (3\_%). For the first time for dogs in Albania, fecal examination indicated
        the occurrence of Hammondia / Neospora -like (0.2\_%), Angiostrongylus lungworm
        (0.3\_%), capillariid (2.8\_%), and Linguatula (0.2\_%) infections. Single
        and multiple infections with up to seven parasites concurrently were found
        in 152 (25.2\_%, 95\_% CI 21.8\u201328.9) and 93 dogs (15.4\_%, 95\_% CI 12.7\u201318.6),
        respectively. On univariate analysis, the dog\u2019s age, the dog\u2019s purpose
        (pet, hunting dog, working dog), the dog\u2019s habitat (city, suburban, rural),
        and environment (mainly indoors, indoors with regular outside walking, yard,
        kennel/run), presence/absence of other dogs and/or cats, history of anthelmintic
        use, and season of examination were identified as significant ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.05)
        factors predisposing dogs to various types of endoparasitism while the variables
        breed (pure breed dogs vs. mixed-breed dogs), gender, and type of food were
        not significant predictors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis for
        factors associated with overall endoparasitism revealed that dogs \\u003e1\_year
        of age (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20090.64), dogs dewormed at least once per

        (OR\u2009=\u20090.51, 0.15, and 0.20, respectively) had a significantly lower
        risk compared with \u22641\_year old dogs, dogs not dewormed, or dogs tested
        during winter. The odds of a dog to be diagnosed positive for endoparasites
        was 1.56 times higher for dogs living together with other pets than that for
        a dog without other dogs or cats.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13538-015-0361-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13538-015-0361-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13538-015-0361-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13538-015-0361-8\"}],\"title\":\"Finite-size

        Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), along with the physiological equivalent temperature
        (PET), the humidex (HX) and the wind chill index (WC), was calculated in Quebec
        City, Canada, a city with a strong seasonal climatic variability, over a 1-year
        period. The objective of this study is twofold: evaluate the operational benefits
        of implementing the UTCI for a climate monitoring program of public comfort
        and health awareness as opposed to relying on traditional and simple indices,
        and determine whether thermal comfort monitoring specific to dense urban neighborhoods
        is necessary to adequately fulfill the goals of the program. In order to do
        so, an analysis is performed to evaluate each of these indices\u2019 sensitivity
        to the meteorological variables that regulate them in different environments.
        Overall, the UTCI was found to be slightly more sensitive to mean radiant
        temperature, moderately more sensitive to humidity and much more sensitive
        to wind speed than the PET. This dynamic changed slightly depending on the
        environment and the season. In hot weather, the PET was found to be more sensitive
        to mean radiant temperature and therefore reached high values that could potentially
        be hazardous more frequently than the UTCI and the HX. In turn, the UTCI\u2019s
        stronger sensitivity to wind speed makes it a superior index to identify potentially
        hazardous weather in winter compared to the PET and the WC. Adopting the UTCI
        broadly would be an improvement over the traditionally popular HX and WC indices.
        The urban environment produced favorable conditions to sustain heat stress
        conditions, where the indices reached high values more frequently there than
        in suburban locations, which advocates for weather monitoring specific to
        denser urban areas.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12055-015-0391-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12055-015-0391-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12055-015-0391-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12055-015-0391-4\"}],\"title\":\"Aortic

        reproduction are unusually common among people with epilepsy. They are generally
        associated with and may be the consequence of reproductive endocrine disorders.
        Epilepsy itself and epileptic seizures have been implicated in their pathophysiology.
        This review focuses on how temporolimbic dysfunction in epilepsy might disrupt
        normal neuroendocrine regulation and promote the development of reproductive
        endocrine disorders. The particular nature of the dysregulation may relate
        to the laterality and focality of the epilepsy and some hormonal changes may
        develop in close temporal relation to the occurrence of epileptiform discharges.
        In women, reproductive endocrine disorders include polycystic ovary syndrome,
        hypothalamic amenorrhea, functional hyperprolactinemia, and premature menopause.
        In men, hypogonadism may be hypogonadotropic, hypergonadotropic or related
        to hyperprolactinemia. The significance of these reproductive endocrine disorders
        is that they may contribute not only to sexual dysfunction and infertility,
        but may also have an adverse impact on seizure control. This review also includes
        sections on special considerations in the treatment of reproductive endocrine
        disorders for women and men with epilepsy.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11019-015-9662-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11019-015-9662-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11019-015-9662-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11019-015-9662-5\"}],\"title\":\"Time,

        Austin Bradford Hill\u2019s \u2018aspects of causation\u2019 represent some
        of the most influential thoughts on the subject of proximate causation in

        known, indicate an increasing likelihood that exposure to a factor causes\u2014or
        contributes to the causation of\u2014a disease. The items of Hill\u2019s list
        were not labelled \u2018criteria\u2019, as this would have inferred every

        causation in health, disease and intervention processes, whether known, knowable,
        or not, remain undetermined and deserve exploration. To move beyond this position,
        this paper aims to explore factors that are necessary in the constitution
        of causative relationships between health, disease processes, and intervention.
        To this end, disease is viewed as a causative pathway through the often overlapping
        stages of aetiology, pathology and patho-physiology. Intervention is viewed
        as a second, independent causative pathway, capable of causing changes in
        health for benefit or harm. For the natural course of a disease pathway to
        change, we argue that intervention must not only occupy the same time and
        space, but must also share a common form; the point at which the two pathways
        converge and interact. This improved conceptualisation may be used to facilitate
        the interpretation of clinical observations and inform future research, particularly
        enabling predictions of the mechanistic relationship between health, disease

        proteomics has relied heavily on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, for
        protein separation and quantification, then single protein isolation, trypsin
        digestion, and mass spectrometric protein identification. Such methods are
        predominantly used for study of high-abundance, full-length proteins. Tissue
        peptidomics has recently been developed but is still used to study the most
        highly abundant species, often resulting in observation and identification
        of dozens of peptides only. Tissue lipidomics is likewise new, and reported
        studies are limited. We have developed an \u201Comics\u201D approach that
        enables over 7,000 low-molecular-weight, low-abundance species to be surveyed
        and have applied this to human placental tissue. Because the placenta is believed
        to be involved in complications of pregnancy, its proteomic evaluation is
        of substantial interest. In previous research on the placental proteome, abundant,
        high-molecular-weight proteins have been studied. Application of large-scale,
        global proteomics or peptidomics to the placenta have been limited, and would
        be challenging owing to the anatomic complexity and broad concentration range

        inequalities between ethnic groups are found in many multiethnic societies.
        A widely used model for explaining these inequalities posits that social inequalities
        among ethnic groups account for a large portion of differences in their health
        statuses. By analyzing gaps in morbidity in Israel between the Palestinian
        minority and the Jewish majority, this study applies this model in a context
        characterized by large social inequalities. Propensity score matching is applied
        to form two ethnic groups, minority and majority, with similar social positions,
        using data from the Israel Health Survey 1999\u20132000. The matched groups
        are then compared in prevalence of two chronic diseases: diabetes and heart
        disease. In addition, reduction in the ethnic health gap is decomposed into
        two components: size of social inequalities between the two groups and strength
        of the socioeconomic gradient of health among the majority group. Results
        show that social inequality may only partially account for higher morbidity
        among the Palestinian minority. Reduction in the female gap was higher than
        that in the male gap, which reflects larger social inequalities between females
        in addition to a stronger female socioeconomic gradient of health. Results

        with chemotherapy and local radiotherapy without tumor recurrence for 11\_years
        and 11\_months, respectively.ConclusionIntracranial germinomas may potentially
        present with spinal recurrence many years after successful initial WV radiotherapy.
        Physicians must be aware of patients\u2019 symptoms during the clinical examination.
        Regular long-term monitoring, including spinal examination, is necessary for
        5\u201310\_years or longer.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11277-015-3058-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11277-015-3058-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11277-015-3058-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-015-3058-y\"}],\"title\":\"Performance

        sensor network consists of sensor nodes with battery operated device. The
        key challenges in the wireless sensor network are energy consumption and routing
        optimization. This work presents the cluster based load balancing (CBLB) routing
        protocol. The proposed routing protocol is used to minimize the energy consumption
        and increase the routing performance. It avoids the routing robustness, delay
        and increases the delivery rate and network performance. In existing techniques,
        different routing protocols such as LEACH, HEED and MESTER were used to increase
        the network performance and to decrease the energy consumption. But these
        existing techniques did not satisfy the performance requirements of wireless
        sensor networks. Hence, there is a requirement to develop a technique that
        meets the QoS requirements and needs of wireless sensor network. The proposed
        CBLB routing protocol creates a cluster head in the decentralized network
        and the cluster head will be used to distribute the workload evenly to the
        cluster members for reducing the energy consumption in wireless sensor network.
        Experimental results analyze the performance of the proposed protocol with
        the different existing protocols. The proposed protocol achieves high throughput,
        delivery rate and reduces the energy consumption, delay and routing overhead.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10826-015-0285-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10826-015-0285-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10826-015-0285-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10826-015-0285-5\"}],\"title\":\"Parenting

        Indian immigrant parents of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities
        (IDD) have unique experiences and challenges grounded within their cultural
        contexts and migration to United States. This study sought to describe these
        experiences using qualitative method. Open-ended interviews were individually
        conducted with 15 Asian Indian parents (8 mothers, 7 fathers) whose children
        were diagnosed with Down Syndrome, Autistic Disorder, or Pervasive Developmental
        Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified. Qualitative analysis generated 16 themes
        that were grouped into five domains: Cultural explanations, community response,
        and migration; impact on the self and family; sources of stress and support;
        a unique parenting approach; and hopes and fears for the future. In particular,
        parents described their local community\u2019s initial struggles with acceptance
        of IDD grounded within religious explanations of the disability. Similar to
        parents of children with IDD from other cultural groups, these parents described
        family support, broader social awareness and acceptance, and access to resources
        as sources of support and the lack of these factors as contributing to stress.
        A unique parenting approach emerged in reference to the child with IDD that
        included adjusting academic aspirations for the child, taking a practical,
        \u201C1\_day at a time\u201D approach, and efforts to pass on cultural heritage.
        Parents voiced concerns about the future care of their child when they would
        not be around, as well as their hopes. These findings suggest the importance
        of attending to cultural meanings and local contexts when understanding parenting

        Beitrag versucht, die duale Realit\xE4t zu verdeutlichen, die sich in den
        einerseits neuesten strengen regulatorischen Anforderungen an russische gemeinn\xFCtzige

        Reihe von Gesetzen und Verordnungen, die eine beeindruckende \u201EToolbox\u201Cvon

        sozialorientierter russischer gemeinn\xFCtziger Organisationen darstellt,
        zeigt. Dazu ist die Diskussion in drei Teile unterteilt. Zun\xE4chst dokumentiert
        der Beitrag das betr\xE4chtliche Ausma\xDF der russischen gemeinn\xFCtzigen
        Organisationen, wie es in durchgef\xFChrten empirischen Forschungsarbeiten
        zu sehen ist. Anschlie\xDFend werden die wichtigsten sich auf die gemeinn\xFCtzigen
        Organisationen auswirkenden politischen Ma\xDFnahmen zusammengefasst, die
        von der russischen Regierung seit Ende des ersten Jahrzehnts im 21. Jahrhundert
        eingef\xFChrt wurden. Doch anders als bei anderen Schilderungen konzentriert
        man sich hier sowohl auf die in diesem Zeitraum entstandene interessante \u201EToolbox\u201Cvon
        Unterst\xFCtzungsprogrammen f\xFCr gemeinn\xFCtzige Organisationen als auch
        auf die restriktiveren regulatorischen Ma\xDFnahmen, wie das verabschiedete
        \u201EAuslandsagenten-Gesetz\u201C. Abschlie\xDFend versucht der Beitrag,
        das Puzzle zu l\xF6sen, das sich aus diesen scheinbar konkurrierenden Realit\xE4ten
        der russischen Regierungspolitik gegen\xFCber gemeinn\xFCtzigen Organisationen
        ergibt, indem die von Graham Allison formulierten begrifflichen Perspektiven
        zur Anwendung gebracht werden, mit Hilfe derer er die kuriosen Ma\xDFnahmen
        im Zusammenhang mit der Kubakrise vor etwas mehr als 50 Jahren nachzuvollziehen
        versuchte.AbstractThis article seeks to unravel the dual realities represented
        by the juxtaposition of the recent series of harsh regulatory impositions
        on Russian nonprofit organizations and the nearly simultaneous enactment of
        a series of laws and decrees establishing an impressive \u201Ctool box\u201D
        of positive support programs for a large class of the so-called socially oriented
        Russian nonprofit organizations. To do so, the discussion proceeds in three
        steps.\_First, the article documents the considerable scale of the Russian
        NPO scene as it is visible through the lens of available empirical research.
        Next, it outlines the key policy measures affecting nonprofit organizations
        (NPOs) put in place by the Russian government beginning in the latter part
        of the first decade of the 21st century.\_Unlike some accounts, however, this
        one brings into focus both the interesting \u201Ctool box\u201D of support
        programs for NPOs enacted during this period as well as the more restrictive
        regulatory measures, such as the \u201Cforeign agents law,\u201D that also
        came into force. Finally, the article seeks to unravel the puzzle posed by
        these apparently competing realities of Russian government policy toward nonprofit
        organizations by bringing to bear the conceptual lenses that Graham Allison
        formulated to make sense of the strange series of actions that surrounded
        the Cuban Missile Crisis a little over 50\_years ago.\u0645\u0644\u062E\u0635\u062A\u0633\u0639\u0649

        presente art\xEDculo trata de desentra\xF1ar las realidades duales representadas
        por la yuxtaposici\xF3n de la reciente serie de imposiciones regulatorias
        sobre las organizaciones rusas sin \xE1nimo de lucro y la casi simult\xE1nea
        aplicaci\xF3n de una serie de leyes y decretos que establecen una impresionante
        \u201Ccaja de herramientas\u201D de programas de apoyo positivos para una
        amplia clase de las denominadas organizaciones rusas sin \xE1nimo de lucro
        orientadas socialmente. Para hacerlo, el debate prosigue en tres pasos. En
        primer lugar, el art\xEDculo documenta la considerable escala de la escena
        de las OSL/NPO rusas ya que es visible a trav\xE9s de las lentes de la investigaci\xF3n
        emp\xEDrica disponible. En segundo lugar, esboza las medidas pol\xEDticas
        claves que afectan a las organizaciones sin \xE1nimo de lucro (OSL/NPO) implantadas
        por el gobierno ruso a comienzos de la \xFAltima parte de la primera d\xE9cada
        del siglo XXI. A diferencia de algunas consideraciones, sin embargo, esto
        centra la atenci\xF3n tanto en la interesante \u201Ccaja de herramientas\u201D
        de programas de apoyo para las OSL/NPO promulgadas durante este per\xEDodo,
        as\xED como tambi\xE9n en las medidas regulatorias m\xE1s restrictivas, tales
        como las \u201Cleyes de agentes extranjeros\u201D que tambi\xE9n entraron
        en vigor. Finalmente, el art\xEDculo trata de desentra\xF1ar el rompecabezas
        planteado por estas realidades aparentemente contradictorias de la pol\xEDtica
        gubernamental rusa hacia las organizaciones sin \xE1nimo de lucro aplicando
        las lentes conceptuales que Graham Allison formul\xF3 para dar sentido a la
        extra\xF1a serie de acciones que rodearon la Crisis de los Misiles Cubanos
        hace poco m\xE1s de 50 a\xF1os.R\xE9sum\xE9Cet article cherche \xE0 d\xE9m\xEAler
        la double r\xE9alit\xE9 repr\xE9sent\xE9e par la juxtaposition de la r\xE9cente
        s\xE9rie de r\xE8glementations s\xE9v\xE8res portant sur les organisations
        \xE0 but non lucratif russes, et l\u2019adoption presque simultan\xE9e d\u2019une
        s\xE9rie de lois et de d\xE9crets instituant une impressionnante\_\xAB\_bo\xEEte
        \xE0 outils\_\xBB\_de programmes de soutien positifs pour une vaste cat\xE9gorie
        d\u2019organisations \xE0 but non lucratif russes dites \xE0 vocation sociale.
        Pour ce faire, l\u2019analyse proc\xE8de en trois \xE9tapes. Tout d\u2019abord,
        l\u2019article contient des informations sur l\u2019ampleur consid\xE9rable
        de la sc\xE8ne russe des organisations \xE0 but non lucratif, telle que l\u2019on
        peut la voir \xE0 travers le prisme des recherches empiriques disponibles.
        Ensuite, il d\xE9crit les mesures politiques cl\xE9s qui affectent les organisations
        \xE0 but non lucratif (OBNL) mises en place par le gouvernement russe au d\xE9but
        de la derni\xE8re partie de la premi\xE8re d\xE9cennie du XXIe si\xE8cle.
        Contrairement \xE0 certains t\xE9moignages, cependant, celui-ci clarifie la\_\xAB\_bo\xEEte
        \xE0 outils\_\xBB\_des programmes de soutien pour les OBNL adopt\xE9s au cours
        de cette p\xE9riode, ainsi que des mesures r\xE8glementaires plus restrictives,
        comme la loi sur les\_\xAB\_agents \xE9trangers\_\xBB\_, \xE9galement entr\xE9e
        en vigueur. Enfin, l\u2019article cherche \xE0 d\xE9m\xEAler l\u2019\xE9nigme
        pos\xE9e par les r\xE9alit\xE9s apparemment concurrentes de la politique du
        gouvernement russe \xE0 l\u2019\xE9gard des organisations \xE0 but non lucratif
        en mettant en valeur les visions conceptuelles formul\xE9es par Graham Allison
        pour comprendre l\u2019\xE9trange vague de mesures ayant entour\xE9 la crise

        the spread of infectious diseases. Due to increasing knowledge about the immune
        system and its role in malignant disease, the development of therapeutic vaccines,
        which are intended to treat established tumors, has begun. For the induction
        of therapeutic immunity towards tumors, either tumor-specific or overexpressed
        antigens can be used. Tumor-specific antigens are mainly or exclusively expressed
        in tumors. It is assumed that they can thus be more easily recognized by the
        immune system than overexpressed antigens. Overexpressed antigens are expressed
        in both tumors and healthy tissues and therefore bear the risk of autoimmunity.
        In this review article, we discuss different approaches of therapeutic cancer
        vaccinations based on cells and on other drug substances. Moreover, we address
        the possibilities of authorizing cancer vaccines in the EU and in Germany.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00381-015-2906-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00381-015-2906-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00381-015-2906-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00381-015-2906-0\"}],\"title\":\"Transumbilical

        purpose of this study was to report transumbilical arterial embolization of
        a large dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in a low-birth-weight neonate with
        congestive heart failure (CHF).Case presentationA female neonate was delivered
        by cesarean section at 31\_weeks of gestation. Her birth weight was 1538\_g
        and Apgar scores were 6 at both 1 and 5\_min. Because of dyspnea and retracted
        respiration immediately after birth, she required mechanical ventilation.
        Ultrasound revealed right cardiac overload and a large cystic mass at the
        posterior brain. Magnetic resonance imaging on day 1 showed a large dural
        AVF (dural sinus malformation with arteriovenous (AV) shunts) at the torcular
        herophili. Umbilical artery and vein catheterization were performed on the
        same day for neurointervention. CHF prompted emergency embolization on day
        8. The transfemoral arterial route could not be used because of its small
        size and compromised femoral artery blood flow. Transumbilical arterial embolization
        shrank the AV shunts markedly, resulting in clinical improvement, thus requiring
        no further intervention. Follow-up angiography at 4\_months confirmed no residual
        AVF. Her growth and development were normal at the last follow-up at age 4\_years.ConclusionThis
        patient apparently was the lowest birth weight neonate with a large AVF successfully
        treated by embolization, which is usually performed through the transfemoral
        arterial route. The transumbilical arterial route is an alternative for neonates
        with birth weight \\u003c2000\_g and very small femoral arteries.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10723-015-9343-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10723-015-9343-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10723-015-9343-x\"}],\"title\":\"Topology-Aware

        computed tomography (CT) is considered the gold standard for detection lung
        pathology, yet its efficacy as a screening tool in regards to cost and radiation
        dose continues to evolve. Chest radiography (CXR) remains a useful and ubiquitous
        tool for detection and characterization of pulmonary pathology, but reduced
        sensitivity and specificity compared to CT. This prospective, blinded study
        compares the sensitivity of digital tomosynthesis (DTS), to that of CT and
        CXR for the identification and characterization of lung nodules. Ninety-five
        outpatients received a posteroanterior (PA) and lateral CXR, DTS, and chest
        CT at one care episode. The CXR and DTS studies were independently interpreted
        by three thoracic radiologists. The CT studies were used as the gold standard
        and read by a fourth thoracic radiologist. Nodules were characterized by presence,
        location, size, and composition. The agreement between observers and the effective
        radiation dose for each modality was objectively calculated. One hundred forty-five
        nodules of greatest diameter larger than 4\_mm and 215 nodules less than 4\_mm
        were identified by CT. DTS identified significantly more \\u003e4\_mm nodules
        than CXR (DTS 32\_% vs. CXR 17\_%). CXR and DTS showed no significant difference
        in the ability to identify the smaller nodules or central nodules within 3\_cm
        of the hilum. DTS outperformed CXR in identifying pleural nodules and those
        nodules located greater than 3\_cm from the hilum. Average radiation dose
        for CXR, DTS, and CT were 0.10, 0.21, and 6.8\_mSv, respectively. Thoracic
        digital tomosynthesis requires significantly less radiation dose than CT and
        nearly doubles the sensitivity of that of CXR for the identification of lung
        nodules greater than 4\_mm. However, sensitivity and specificity for detection
        and characterization of lung nodules remains substantially less than CT. The
        apparent benefits over CXR, low cost, rapid acquisition, and minimal radiation
        dose of thoracic DTS suggest that it may be a useful procedure. Work-up of
        a newly diagnosed nodule will likely require CT, given its superior cross-sectional
        characterization. Further investigation of DTS as a diagnostic, screening,
        and surveillance tool is warranted.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0923-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0923-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0923-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-015-0923-7\"}],\"title\":\"Management

        consisting of dense thickets and agricultural plots. We assessed the occurrence
        of the Kenyan endemic riparian bird species Hindes\xB4 Babbler Turdoides hindei

        Based on these data we calculated habitat preferences and population structure

        confirm a relationship between diet quality and both depression and cognitive
        health in adults. While the biological pathways that underpin these relationships
        are likely multitudinous, extensive evidence from animal studies points to
        the involvement of the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to examine the
        association between dietary patterns and hippocampal volume in humans, and
        to assess whether diet was associated with differential rates of hippocampal
        atrophy over time.MethodsData were drawn from the Personality and Total Health
        Through Life Study and focused on a subsample of the cohort (n = 255) who
        were aged 60\u201364 years at baseline in 2001, completed a food frequency
        questionnaire, and underwent two magnetic resonance imaging scans approximately
        4 years apart. Longitudinal generalized estimating equation linear regression
        models were used to assess the association between dietary factors and left
        and right hippocampal volumes over time.ResultsEvery one standard deviation
        increase in healthy \u201Cprudent\u201D dietary pattern was associated with
        a 45.7 mm^3 (standard error 22.9 mm^3) larger left hippocampal volume, while
        higher consumption of an unhealthy \u201CWestern\u201D dietary pattern was
        (independently) associated with a 52.6 mm^3 (SE 26.6 mm^3) smaller left hippocampal
        volume. These relationships were independent of covariates including age,
        gender, education, labour-force status, depressive symptoms and medication,
        physical activity, smoking, hypertension and diabetes. While hippocampal volume
        declined over time, there was no evidence that dietary patterns influenced
        this decline. No relationships were observed between dietary patterns and

        and higher intakes of unhealthy foods are each independently associated with

        influences the interpretation of nuclear medicine based images and consequently
        their use in treatment planning and monitoring. However, no standardised method
        for evaluating and ranking heterogeneity exists. Here, we have developed a
        general algorithm that provides a ranking and a visualisation of the heterogeneity
        in small animal positron emission tomography (PET) images.MethodsThe code
        of the algorithm was written using the Matrix Laboratory software (MATLAB).
        Parameters known to influence the heterogeneity (distances between deviating
        peaks, gradients and size compensations) were incorporated into the algorithm.
        All data matrices were mathematically constructed in the same format with
        the aim of maintaining overview and control. Histograms visualising the spread
        and frequency of contributions to the heterogeneity were also generated. The
        construction of the algorithm was tested using mathematically generated matrices
        and by varying post-processing parameters. It was subsequently applied in
        comparisons of radiotracer uptake in preclinical images in human head and
        neck carcinoma and endothelial and ovarian carcinoma xenografts.ResultsUsing
        the developed algorithm, entire tissue volumes could be assessed and gradients
        could be handled in an indirect manner. Similar-sized volumes could be compared
        without modifying the algorithm. Analyses of the distribution of different
        tracers gave results that were generally in accordance with single plane preclinical
        images, indicating that it could appropriately handle comparisons of targeting
        vs. non-targeting tracers and also for different target levels. Altering the
        reconstruction algorithm, pixel size, tumour ROI volumes and lower cut-off
        limits affected the calculated heterogeneity factors in expected directions
        but did not reverse conclusions about which tumour was more or less heterogeneous.ConclusionsThe

        one-to-one comparisons of heterogeneity in whole similar-sized tumour volumes

        of the most controversial areas of animal research is the use of nonhuman
        primates for fundamental research. At the centre of the controversy is the
        question of whether the benefits of research outweigh the harms. We argue
        that the evaluation of harms and benefits is highly problematic. We describe
        some common procedures in neurological research using nonhuman primates and
        the difficulties in evaluating the harm involved. Even if the harm could be
        quantified, it is unlikely that it could be meaningfully aggregated over different
        procedures, let alone different animals. A similar problem arises for evaluating
        benefits. It is not clear how benefits could be quantified, and even if they
        could be, values for different aspects of expected benefits cannot be simply
        added up. Sorting harms and benefits in three or four categories cannot avoid
        the charge of arbitrariness and runs the risk of imposing its structure on
        the moral decision. The metaphor of weighing or balancing harms and benefits
        is inappropriate for the moral decision about whether to use nonhuman primates
        for research. Arguing that the harms and benefits in this context are incommensurable,
        we suggest describing the moral consideration of harms and benefits as a coherent
        trade - off . Such a decision does not require commensurability. It must be
        well-informed about the suffering involved and the potential benefits, it
        must be consistent with the legal, regulatory and institutional framework
        within which it is made, and it must cohere with other judgments in relevant

        is one of the promising evolutionary approaches for solving multi and many-objective
        optimization problems. MOEA/D decomposes a multi-objective optimization problem
        into a number of single objective optimization problems. Each single objective
        optimization problem is defined by a scalarizing function using a weight vector.
        In MOEA/D, there are several scalarizing approaches such as weighted Tchebycheff,
        reciprocal weighted Tchebycheff, weighted sum (WS) and penalty-based boundary
        intersection (PBI). Each scalarizing function has a characteristic effect
        on the search performance of MOEA/D and provides a scenario of multi-objective
        solution search. To improve the availability of MOEA/D framework for solving
        various kinds of problems, it is important to provide a new scalarizing function
        which has different characteristics from the conventional scalarizing functions.
        In particular, the conventional scalarizing approaches face a difficulty to
        approximate a widely spread Pareto front in some problems. To approximate
        the entire Pareto front by improving the spread of solutions in the objective
        space and enhance the search performance of MOEA/D in multi and many-objective
        optimization problems, in this work we propose the inverted PBI scalarizing
        approach which is an extension of the conventional PBI and WS. In this work,
        we analyze differences between inverted PBI and other scalarizing functions,
        and compare the search performances of NSGA-III and five MOEA/Ds using weighted
        Tchebycheff, reciprocal weighted Tchebycheff, WS, PBI and inverted PBI in
        many-objective knapsack problems and WFG4 problems with 2\u20138 objectives.
        As results, we show that the inverted PBI based MOEA/D achieves higher search
        performance than other algorithms in problems with many-objectives and the
        difficulty to approximate a widely spread Pareto front in the objective space.
        Also, we show the robustness of the inverted PBI on Pareto front geometry
        by using problems with four representative concave, linear, convex and discontinuous
        Pareto fronts.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00105-015-3680-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00105-015-3680-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00105-015-3680-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00105-015-3680-3\"}],\"title\":\"Erfolgreiche

        article reports insights from a 4-day Gathering of Native American Healers
        at the University of Michigan in October of 2010. This event convened 18 traditional
        healers, clinically trained service providers, and cross-cultural mental health
        researchers for a structured group dialogue to advance professional knowledge
        about the integration of Indigenous healing practices and conventional mental
        health treatments in community-based mental health services for Native Americans.
        Our thematic analysis of transcripts from five Roundtable sessions afforded
        several key insights and understandings pertaining to the integration of Indigenous
        healing and conventional mental health services. First, with reference to
        traditional healing, the importance of a rampant relationality, various personal
        qualities, Indigenous spirituality, and maintenance of traditional life and
        culture were accentuated by Roundtable participants. Second, for traditional
        healers to practice effectively, Roundtable participants posited that these
        individuals must maintain personal wellness, cultivate profound knowledge
        of healing practices, recognize the intrinsic healing potential within all
        human beings, and work for the community rather than themselves. In speaking
        to the possibilities and challenges of collaboration between Indigenous and
        conventional biomedical therapeutic approaches, Roundtable participants recommended
        the implementation of cultural programming, the observance of mutuality and
        respect, the importance of clear and honest communication, and the need for
        awareness of cultural differences as unique challenges that must be collaboratively

        messageWe assessed tree frost tolerance using electrolyte leakage and a method
        based on irreversible diameter change of branches. It was shown that irreversible
        diameter change correlates with electrolyte leakage and USDA hardiness rating
        and is a good indicator of frost tolerance.ContextThe number of potential
        tree species for urban green planning is low in northern latitudes where cold
        tolerance is a critical factor. High cost of urban tree establishment calls
        for reliable and preferably non-destructive methods for determining their
        cold tolerance.AimsWe studied the cellular damage occurring during freezing
        and thawing in branches of seven broadleaved tree species using electrolyte
        leakage and a method based on branch diameter changes.MethodsCellular damage
        in branches was studied during the cold-hardy stage in winter and the dehardening
        stage in early spring in laboratory conditions using both monitoring of frost-induced
        diameter changes and the common electrolyte leakage method during temperature
        decrease to \u221225\_\xB0C.ResultsFrost-induced irreversible diameter shrinkage
        correlated positively with electrolyte leakage. Out of the seven studied species,
        Quercus palustris and Crataegus monogyna had the highest frost tolerance during
        the dehardening stage in early spring, whereas Pterocarya fraxinifolia was
        the least frost tolerant.ConclusionIrreversible shrinkage of branch diameter
        due to freezing stress is a good and non-destructive method to indicate frost
        tolerance. It also correlates well with the USDA plant hardiness rating that
        is based on the minimum temperature range in which the studied species prevail

        excitation and damping parameters on the superharmonic and primary resonance
        responses of a slender cantilever beam undergoing flapping motion is investigated.
        The problem is cast into mathematical form using a nonlinear inextensible
        beam model which is subjected to time-dependent boundary conditions and linear
        or nonlinear damping forces. The flapping excitation is assumed to be non-harmonic,
        composed of two sine waves with different amplitudes. We employ a combination
        of Galerkin and perturbation methods to arrive at the frequency\u2013response
        relationships associated with the second- and third-order superharmonic and
        primary resonances. The resonance solutions of the spatially discretized equation
        of motion, which involves both quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms, are constructed
        as first-order uniform asymptotic expansions via the method of multiple timescales.
        The effect of excitation and damping parameters on the steady-state resonance
        responses and their stability is described quantitatively using approximate
        analytical expressions. The critical excitation amplitudes leading to bistable
        solutions are identified. For the second-order superharmonic resonance, the
        critical excitation amplitude is determined to be dependent on the first-harmonic
        amplitude in the case of nonlinear damping. The third-order superharmonic
        resonance is determined to be independent of the second-harmonic excitation
        amplitude regardless of the damping types considered. The perturbation solutions
        are compared with numerical time-spectral solutions for different flapping
        amplitudes. The first-order perturbation solution is determined to be in very
        good agreement with the numerical solution up to 5\xB0 while above this amplitude
        differences in the two solutions develop, which are attributed to phase estimation
        accuracy.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00153-015-0446-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00153-015-0446-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00153-015-0446-7\"}],\"title\":\"The

        paper investigates the cause of the spurious waves generated at the domain

        The spurious waves are caused by the missing information when imposing boundary
        conditions for subcritical flows over irregular topography adjacent to the
        boundaries. The resulting boundary disturbances are likely to affect the flow
        solution inside the domain. To prevent the generation of such boundary spurious

        the effects of wave height, water depth, boundary topographic features (i.e.,

        to exploit these properties, SWNTs must be de-bundled in a surfactant solution
        to permit processing and use. We report a new method to prepare a SWNT-based
        transparent conducting film (TCF) using the diazo dye 3,3\u2032-([1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-4,4\u2032-diyl)bis(4-amino
        naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid), commonly known as Congo red (CR), as a dispersant.
        Uniform 20-nm-thick TCFs were prepared on rigid glass and flexible polyethylene
        terephthalate (PET) substrates. The CR-SWNT dispersion and the CR-SWNT TCFs
        were characterized via UV-Vis-NIR, Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy,
        transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy
        (FE-SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. The sheet resistivity
        of the CRSWNT TCF was ~34 \xB1 6.6 \u03A9/\u25A1 with a transmittance of 81%
        at 550 nm, comparable to that of indium tin oxide-based films. Unlike SWNT
        dispersions prepared in common surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate
        (SDS), sodium cholate (SC), and Triton X-100, the CR-SWNT dispersion was amenable
        to forming TCF by drop coating. The CR-SWNT TCF was also very stable, maintaining
        a very low sheet resistivity even after 1,000 consecutive bending cycles of
        8 mm bending radius. Further, manganese dioxide (MnO_2) was electrochemically
        deposited on the CR-SWNT-PET film (MnO_2-CR-SWNT-PET). The as-prepared MnO_2-CR-SWNT-PET

        4\_weeks post-delivery and 27\_% were using modern contraceptive methods.
        Low socio-economic position was the most important predictor of underutilization
        with a clear gradient across SEP quintiles. Compared to the poorest, the least
        poor women were more likely to be registered for ANC (OR 1.96, 95\_%CI 0.95-4.15)
        and more likely to have made\u2009\u2265\u20094 ANC visits (OR 5.86, 95\_%CI
        2.82-12.19). They were more likely to have given birth in a facility (OR 4.87,
        95\_%CI 2.12-11.16), to have visited a hospital within one month of childbirth
        (OR 3.18, 95\_%CI 1.62-6.26). In general, government funded health insurance
        and conditional cash transfers schemes were underutilized in this community.ConclusionThe
        poorest segment of the urban poor population utilizes reproductive healthcare
        facilities the least. Strategies to improve access and utilization of healthcare
        services among the poorest of the poor may be necessary to achieve universal

        intrinsic scatter in tensile properties of unidirectional (UD) carbon/epoxy
        composites is due to several factors, including variability in fibre strength
        and fibre volume fraction at the local microscopic level. A model included
        in a multiscale finite element process, previously developed to simulate fibre
        failure in composite laminates but having little variation in fibre strength
        and local fibre volume fraction, has been extended to cover the effects of
        such material variations. The present study investigates the effects of the
        variability in material properties which can occur in real UD composite materials
        subjected to monotonic increasing and sustained loadings. This latter case
        is one of the originalities of this study. In the interval of variation studied
        for the Weibull parameters of fibre strength and fibre volume fraction, the
        mean and standard deviation of the failure stress are never strongly affected.
        Concerning the time-to-failure, its mean and its standard deviation increase
        strongly if the mean of fibre volume fraction increases and if the standard
        deviation of the fibre strength decreases. The standard deviation of local
        fibre volume fraction was found to have only a secondary effect on failure

        partitioning is an essential mechanism enabling species coexistence. The resources
        that are used by an animal are linked to its morphology and ecology. Therefore,
        similar species should use similar resources. The ecological niche of an individual
        summarizes all used resources and is therefore composed of several dimensions.
        Many methods are established to study different dimensions of an animal\u2019s
        niche. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a combination of suitable
        methods is needed to study spatial and dietary resource partitioning of sympatric
        species in detail. We hypothesized that, while each individual method might
        identify differences between species, the combined results of several methods
        will lead to a more complete picture of spatial and dietary resource partitioning.
        As model organisms we chose the sympatric insectivorous bat species Myotis
        bechsteinii , M. nattereri , and P. auritus . We examined horizontal habitat
        use by telemetry, vertical habitat use by measuring \u03B4 ^13C, trophic position

        The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and End-Stage Renal Disease Comorbidity
        Index (ESRD-CI) were used to classify individual comorbid conditions into
        an overall score. Comorbidities were classified using patient charts and electronic
        records. Outcome: All-cause mortality. Confounders: Patient demographics,
        dialysis access, cause of ESRD and baseline laboratory data.MethodsRegression
        coefficients were estimated on the CCI and ESRD-CI. Discrimination for death
        was assessed using Harrell\u2019s c-index. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard
        models were used to calculate relative hazards and 95\_% confidence intervals
        for each category of the CCI and ESRD-CI.ResultsThe cohort consisted of 771
        ESRD patients from 01 Jan 2006 to 01 Jul 2013. Most were male (62\_%) and
        Caucasian (91\_%). The cohort had a high proportion of diabetes (48\_%), history
        of previous myocardial infarction (31\_%) and heart failure (22\_%). Regression
        coefficients on the CCI and ESRD-CI were 0.55 and 0.52, respectively. The
        c -index, for the prediction of death, was 0.61 for the CCI and 0.63 for the
        ESRD-CI. ESRD-CI scores of 4, 5 and \u22656 were associated with a similar
        mortality risk (adjusted relative hazard of 1.95, 1.89 and 1.99, respectively).
        There was a small increased mortality risk for CCI scores of 4, 5 and \u22656
        (adjusted relative hazard of 1.86, 2.38 and 2.71, respectively).LimitationsClassification

        after 2\_h of cerulein injection. 12\_h later, serum was provided to assess
        the blood AST, ALT and LDH values. Also, liver tissues were obtained for histological
        and biochemical measurements. Liver oxidative stress markers were evaluated
        by changes in the amount of lipid peroxides measured as MDA and changes in
        tissue antioxidant enzyme levels, SOD, CAT and GSH-Px. Histopathological examination
        was performed using scoring systems. Oxidative damage to DNA was quantitated
        in studied tissues of experimental animals by measuring the increase in 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine
        (8-OHdG) formations. We found that the increasing doses of CAR decreased pancreatitis-induced
        MDA and 8-OH-dG levels. Moreover, the liver SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities
        in the AP\_+\_CAR group were higher than that of the rats in the AP group.
        In the treatment groups, AST, ALT and LDH were reduced. Besides, necrosis,
        coagulation and inflammation in the liver were alleviated ( p \_\\u003c\_0.05).

        conclusionGreen tissue-specific simultaneous overexpression of two defense-related
        genes ( OsCHI11 \\u0026 OsOXO4 ) in rice leads to significant resistance against
        sheath blight pathogen ( R. solani ) without distressing any agronomically
        important traits. Overexpressing two defense-related genes ( OsOXO4 and OsCHI11
        ) cloned from rice is effective at enhancing resistance against sheath blight
        caused by Rhizoctonia solani . These genes were expressed under the control
        of two different green tissue-specific promoters, viz. maize phosphoenolpyruvate
        carboxylase gene promoter, PEPC , and rice cis -acting 544-bp DNA element,
        immediately upstream of the D54O translational start site, P _ D54O \u2013
        544 . Putative T_0 transgenic rice plants were screened by PCR and integration
        of genes was confirmed by Southern hybridization of progeny (T_1) rice plants.
        Successful expression of OsOXO4 and OsCHI11 in all tested plants was confirmed.
        Expression of PR genes increased significantly following pathogen infection
        in overexpressing transgenic plants. Following infection, transgenic plants
        exhibited elevated hydrogen peroxide levels, significant changes in activity
        of ROS scavenging enzymes and reduced membrane damage when compared to their
        wild-type counterpart. In a Rhizoctonia solani toxin assay, a detached leaf
        inoculation test and an in vivo plant bioassay, transgenic plants showed a
        significant reduction in disease symptoms in comparison to non-transgenic
        control plants. This is the first report of overexpression of two different

        models are currently a dominant framework for describing human information
        processing. However, it is not clear yet how major tenets of this framework
        can be translated to brain processes. In this study, we addressed the neural
        underpinning of prior probability and its effect on anticipatory activity
        in category-specific areas. Before fMRI scanning, participants were trained
        in two behavioral sessions to learn the prior probability and correct order
        of visual events within a sequence. The events of each sequence included two
        different presentations of a geometric shape and one picture of either a house
        or a face, which appeared with either a high or a low likelihood. Each sequence
        was preceded by a cue that gave participants probabilistic information about
        which items to expect next. This allowed examining cue-related anticipatory
        modulation of activity as a function of prior probability in category-specific
        areas (fusiform face area and parahippocampal place area). Our findings show
        that activity in the fusiform face area was higher when faces had a higher
        prior probability. The finding of a difference between levels of expectations
        is consistent with graded, probabilistically modulated activity, but the data
        do not rule out the alternative explanation of a categorical neural response.
        Importantly, these differences were only visible during anticipation, and
        vanished at the time of stimulus presentation, calling for a functional distinction
        when considering the effects of prior probability. Finally, there were no
        anticipatory effects for houses in the parahippocampal place area, suggesting
        sensitivity to stimulus material when looking at effects of prediction.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11704-015-4548-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11704-015-4548-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-015-4548-5\"}],\"title\":\"Topic

        (PC) is a rare endocrine malignancy. The tumor is mostly functioning, causing
        severe primary hyperparathyroidism, with high serum calcium and parathyroid
        hormone (PTH) levels. Nonfunctioning PC is extremely rare. We report a 50-year-old
        male patient who was referred to our Department for a right thyroid nodule,
        incidentally detected on carotid Doppler ultrasound scan, with a fine-needle
        aspiration cytology showing a follicular lesion. At the time of our evaluation,
        neck ultrasound showed a 1.3\_cm right hypoechoic thyroid nodule with irregular
        margins and the absence of enlarged bilateral cervical lymph nodes. Thyroid
        function tests were normal. Serum calcium was normal and plasma PTH slightly
        above the upper limit of the normal range. The patients underwent right lobectomy.
        The intraoperative frozen-section pathological examination raised the suspicion
        of a PC. Definitive histology showed a markedly irregular infiltrative growth
        of the tumor with invasion of the thyroid tissue and cervical soft tissues.
        Immunostaining for thyroglobulin was negative, whereas staining for chromogranin
        A and PTH showed a strong reactivity. Based on the microscopic findings and
        the immunohistochemical profile, the tumor was diagnosed as a PC. Postoperative
        serum calcium and phosphate levels were in the normal range. One month after
        surgery, serum calcium and PTH were normal. Neck ultrasound and total body
        computed tomography scan were negative for local and metastatic disease. Eight
        months later, serum calcium was normal and plasma PTH level remained around
        the upper limit of normal range. Neck ultrasound did not show any pathological
        lesions. This is the first case of a nonfunctioning sporadic PC misdiagnosed
        prior of surgery as a follicular thyroid nodule. The parathyroid nature of
        the neck lesion could not be suspected before surgery. Fine-needle aspiration
        cytology (FNAC) may fail to distinguish a parathyroid tumor from a benign
        thyroid nodule because at FNAC, parathyroid and thyroid lesions have some
        morphological similarities. Histological criteria are not always sufficient
        for the differential diagnosis, which can definitely be established using

        challenges by toxic agents, thereby enhancing survival. Hormesis is highly
        conserved, broadly generalizable, and pleiotrophic, being independent of biological
        model, endpoint measured, inducing agent, level of biological organization
        and mechanism. The low dose stimulatory hormetic response has specific characteristics
        which defines both the quantitative features of biological plasticity and
        the potential for maximum biological performance, thereby estimating the limits
        to which numerous medical and pharmacological interventions may affect humans.
        The substantial degrading of some hormetic processes in the aged may profoundly
        reduce the capacity to respond effectively to numerous environmental/ischemic
        and other stressors leading to compromised health, disease and, ultimately,
        defining the bounds of longevity.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s40319-015-0378-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40319-015-0378-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40319-015-0378-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40319-015-0378-0\"}],\"title\":\"\u201CConverse

        techniques for gastric cancer are gaining more acceptance worldwide as an
        alternative to open resection. In order to assess the role of minimally invasive
        and open techniques in total gastrectomy for cancer, a systematic review and
        meta-analysis was performed. Articles comparing minimally invasive versus
        open total gastrectomy were reviewed, collected from the Medline, Embase,
        and Cochrane databases. Two different authors (JS and NW) independently selected
        and assessed the articles. Outcomes regarding operative results, postoperative
        recovery, morbidity, mortality, and oncological outcomes were analyzed. Statistical
        analysis portrayed the weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95\_% confidence
        interval and odds ratio (OR). Out of 1242 papers, 12 studies were selected,
        including a total of 1360 patients, of which 592 underwent minimally invasive
        total gastrectomy (MITG). Compared to open total gastrectomy (OTG), MITG showed
        a longer operation time (WMD: 48.06\_min, P \_\\u003c\_0.00001), less operative
        blood loss (WMD: \u2212160.70\_mL, P \_\\u003c\_0.00001), faster postoperative
        recovery, measured as shorter time to first flatus (WMD \u22121.05\_days,

        (WMD \u22122.30, P \_=\_0.06). Minimally invasive total gastrectomy showed
        faster postoperative recovery and less postoperative complications, whereas
        completeness of the resection was similar in both groups. Duration of surgery
        was longer in the minimally invasive group. Only comparative non-randomized
        studies were available, further emphasizing the need for a prospective randomized

        studies have found that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has vital
        roles in the development of malignant diseases including glioma. The occurrence
        of TERT promoter mutations in gliomas is frequent. So far, several studies
        on the association between TERT promoter mutations and prognosis of gliomas
        had been published, but the conclusion was still not uncertain. The aim of
        the present meta-analysis was to assess the association between TERT promoter
        mutations and survival of glioma patients by pooling data from published studies.
        PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for articles on the association
        between TERT promoter mutations and survival of glioma patients until June
        30, 2015. Hazard ratios (HR) and the 95\_% confidence intervals (CIs) were
        utilized to analyze the prognosis of glioma patients with TERT promoter mutations.
        Heterogeneity of included studies was assessed using Cochrane\u2019s Q test
        and I ^2 method. Eleven studies with a total of 3,444 glioma patients were
        finally included into the meta-analysis. Nine studies reported the HRs adjusting
        for other confounding factors. Meta-analysis of total 11 studies suggested
        that TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse prognosis
        of patients with gliomas (HR\u2009=\u20092.07, 95\_% CI\u2009=\u20091.58\u20132.71,
        P \u2009\\u003c\u20090.00001). Meta-analysis of nine studies with adjusted

        resistance spot welds of aluminum alloy with good quality and at high volume
        has several obstacles in automotive industry. One of the difficult issues
        arises from the presence of a tough non-conducting oxide film on the aluminum
        sheet surface. The oxide film develops over time and often is non-uniform
        across the surface of the aluminum alloy sheet, which makes the contact resistance
        characteristics irregular at the faying interface during welding. The consistency
        in quality of the final spot welds is therefore problematic to control. To
        suppress the effect of the irregular oxide film on the spot weld quality,
        application of a pre-heating treatment in the welding schedule for aluminum
        alloy 5052 is investigated in this present work. The current level of the
        pre-heating required to reduce the scatter of the contact resistance at the
        W/W (workpiece-to-workpiece) faying interface is quantified experimentally.
        The results indicate that the contact resistance at the W/W faying interface
        with a pre-heating treatment becomes much consistent and can be reduced by
        two orders of magnitude. Having the uncertain variation of the contact resistance
        at the W/W faying surface virtually reduced or removed, the quality of the
        spot welds in terms of the peak load and nugget diameter is examined and shows
        a great improvement. The proposed method may provide a robust method for high-volume

        in the lateral compartment. Charcoal suspension was injected into 10 of the

        the location of the tattoos, the success rate of localization, the intraoperative
        detection rate, and the complications associated with the procedure. The perioperative
        results were compared with those in the control group of 11 patients who did
        not receive charcoal tattooing.ResultsCharcoal suspension was successfully
        injected into 22 of the 23 suspicious lymph nodes (95.7\_%). The remaining
        lesion was located posterior to the internal jugular vein. Therefore, the
        charcoal was injected into the soft tissue around the lymph node. Ultrasound-guided
        injections were well tolerated in all the patients, and no major complications

        of sulphide minerals produces a great variety of efflorescences of soluble
        sulphate salts. These minerals play an important role for environmental pollution,
        since they can be either a sink or a source for acidity and trace elements.
        This paper aims to characterise surface waters affected by mining activities
        in the Sierra Minera of Cartagena-La Union (SE, Spain). Water samples were
        analysed for trace metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu, As and Fe), major ions (Na^+, K^+,
        Ca^2+ and Mg^2+) and anions (F^\u2212, Cl^\u2212, NO_3 ^\u2212, CO_3 ^2\u2212,
        SO_4 ^2\u2212) concentrations and were submitted to an \u201Cevaporation-precipitation\u201D
        experiment that consisted in identifying the salts resulting from the evaporation
        of the water aliquots sampled onsite. Mineralogy of the salts was studied
        using X-ray diffraction and compared with the results of calculations using
        VISUAL MINTEQ. The study area is heavily polluted as a result of historical
        mining and processing activities that has produced large amount of wastes
        characterised by a high trace elements content, acidic pH and containing minerals
        resulting from the supergene alteration of the raw materials. The mineralogical
        study of the efflorescences obtained from waters shows that magnesium, zinc,
        iron and aluminium sulphates predominate in the acid mine drainage precipitates.
        Minerals of the hexahydrite group have been quantified together with minerals
        of the rozenite group, alunogen and other phases such as coquimbite and copiapite.
        Calcium sulphates correspond exclusively to gypsum. In a semiarid climate,
        such as that of the study area, these minerals contribute to understand the
        response of the system to episodic rainfall events. MINTEQ model could be
        used for the analysis of waters affected by mining activities but simulation
        of evaporation gives more realistic results considering that MINTEQ does not
        consider soluble hydrated salts.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/JHEP09(2015)037\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/JHEP09(2015)037\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/JHEP09(2015)037\"}],\"title\":\"Standard

        (CBZ) is a representative of a group of compounds found in our rivers that
        have been classified as upcoming contaminants. Its pharmacological activity
        to treat mood and neurological disorders is based on its effects on ion channels,
        but effects on aquatic organisms have not yet been thoroughly investigated.
        In our initial analysis, we compared CBZ effects on two microalgae species
        differing in CBZ sensitivity: Parachlorella kessleri and Neochloris pseudoalveolaris.
        While we observed a stimulation in the growth rate in cultures of P. kessleri
        in the presence of 10\_\u03BCg\_L^\u22121 CBZ, no effect on growth rates of
        N. pseudoalveolaris cultures could be documented at this concentration. Any
        higher tested CBZ concentration led to growth inhibition. To gain insight
        into these effects, biochemical and physiological parameters of these two
        microalgae species were measured in the presence of CBZ in a concentration-dependent
        manner. As the severe inhibition of growth rate correlated with a significant
        inhibition of most tested parameters in cultures of N. pseudoalveolaris ,
        the primary reason for the adverse effect of CBZ on cultures of this microalgae
        species could not be identified. In cultures of N. pseudoalveolaris , experimental
        data indicate that inhibition of growth rate occurs when the microalgae are
        no longer able to compensate for adverse CBZ-induced ROS effects. Analysis
        of the CBZ response of cultures of P. kessleri showed a reduction of growth
        stimulatory effect if the CBZ concentration exceeds a threshold value. In
        general, cultures of P. kessleri show a great potential to withstand CBZ as
        an environmental pollutant.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11704-015-4320-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11704-015-4320-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-015-4320-x\"}],\"title\":\"Distribution

        I intend to do in the following pages is to focus on what might be termed
        the most important turn in the very dimension of ideality throughout the history

        notion of idea, and especially its singular contemporary destiny. In the first
        part of the article, I am going to analyze Kant\u2019s introduction of the
        notion of ideal and Hegel\u2019s reading of it, and I am going to argue that
        the former affirms a dualistic relationship which the latter negates. In the
        second part of the article, I am going to reason on the actual effects of
        both the affirmation and the negation of the dualism between the ideal and
        the real, especially focusing on the forms of totalitarianism and anarchism
        which characterized the twentieth-century history of Western culture. This
        will lead me to argue that we should try to avoid both the bad uses of the
        ideal (namely, the idealization of the real and the debasement of the real
        through the ideal) and the death of the ideal (namely, forms of epistemological
        and ethical anarchism) in order to work on a notion of ideal which could be
        an exceedingly promising tool for us to change and improve the real. This
        change and improvement can be achieved through the affirmation of the dualistic
        relationship between the ideal and the real, and more specifically through
        what I will call an evolutionary notion of ideal versus a revolutionary notion

        the expansion of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) into child welfare settings,

        practice. Implementation scientists suggest that multiple factors influence
        quality EBI delivery and ultimately positive outcomes. To understand the applicability
        of existing implementation evidence for child welfare settings and to document
        real-world experiences of EBI implementation in this setting, this study interviewed
        program staff from two child welfare agencies in two separate states. We sought
        their perspectives on what helps and what hinders EBI implementation. Transcripts
        were coded and analyzed with a modified analytic induction approach. This
        analytic technique permitted researchers to confirm or disconfirm prior research
        on key implementation factors. Findings describe the role of six broad factors
        consistent with extant literature: process, provider, innovation, client,
        organizational, and structural. Front line workers conceptualized these factors
        as distinct but interrelated and viewed them as influencing the success of
        EBI implementation. Child welfare staff made several important suggestions
        including: interactive, engaging training; coaching supports that facilitate
        high-fidelity implementation alongside well-tailored interventions; organizational
        supports and leadership that create a welcoming environment for the EBI, including
        adequate resources for the day-to-day use of the EBI and proactive problem-solving
        to manage the inevitable unforeseen implementation barriers; and, efforts
        to actively educate and gain the buy-in of external stakeholders. As EBIs
        continue to expand into child welfare settings, local implementers should
        carefully consider how various factors at multiple levels may impede or facilitate

        elastic modulus of a deposit ( E _d) can be obtained by monitoring the temperature
        (\u0394 T ) and curvature (\u0394 k ) of a one-side coated long plate, namely,
        a onedimensional (1D) deformation model. The aim of this research is to design
        an experimental setup that proves whether a 1D deformation model can be scaled
        for complex geometries. The setup includes a laser displacement sensor mounted
        on a robotic arm capable of scanning a specimen surface and measuring its
        deformation. The reproducibility of the results is verified by comparing the
        present results with Stony Brook University Laboratory\u2019s results. The
        \u0394 k -\u0394 T slope error is less than 8%, and the E _d estimation error
        is close to 2%. These values reveal the repeatability of the experiments.
        Several samples fabricated with aluminum as the substrate and 100MXC nanowire
        (Fe and Cr alloy) as the deposit are analyzed and compared with those in finite
        element (FE) simulations. The linear elastic behavior of 1D (flat long plate)
        and 2D (squared plate) specimens during heating/cooling cycles is demonstrated
        by the high linearity of all \u0394 k -\u0394 T curves (over 97%). The E _d
        values are approximately equal for 1D and 2D analyses, with a median of 96
        GPa and standard deviation of 2 GPa. The correspondence between the experimental
        and simulated results for the 1D and 2D specimens reveals that deformation
        and thermal stress in coated specimens can be predicted regardless of specimen
        geometry through FE modeling and by using the experimental value of E _d.
        An example of a turbine-bladeshaped substrate is presented to validate the

        guiding such choice. It is a departure from approaches taken in previous studies
        in the area. Through the laddering interview technique of means-end chain
        analysis, a hierarchical value map was systematically schematized to illustrate
        the relationship between adoption of GAP (attributes), outcomes (consequences),

        These findings suggest that, while profit is not the sole end driver of adoptive

        the goals of achieving core personal values. Other empirical information in

        photocatalyst possessed Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)-specific surface area
        of 104\_m^2/g. The large BET-specific surface area was also corroborated by
        the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images which showed
        porous morphology. In addition, the XRD pattern showed that the visible light-active
        component, CuFe_2O_4, was successfully formed with band gap energy of 1.58\_eV
        determined from the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Significantly,
        it was determined from the blank run study that the visible light was an integral

        degradation was low (\\u003c4.0\_%). In contrast, when visible light was present,

        This can be attributed to splitting of H_2O_2 into hydroxyl (^\u25CFOH) radical.

        of glycerol has further enhanced to record nearly 40.0\_% degradation at a

        in sediments, it changed from year to year between 6.3\_\xD7\_10^6 and 1.75\_\xD7\_10^8,
        increasing with a decrease in temperature. FISH with Archaea - and Bacteria
        -specific probes showed that the share of Bacteria differed with year, changing
        from 34 to 71\_%. According to 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing data, lithoautotrophs
        ( Aquificales and Thermoproteales ) predominated in water samples, while in
        sediments they shared the niche with organotrophic Crenarchaeota, Korarchaeota
        , and bacteria of the genus Caldimicrobium (phylum Thermodesulfobacteria ).
        The majority of organisms in water belonged to cultivated orders of prokaryotes;
        the only large uncultured group was that representing a novel order in class
        Thermoprotei . In sediments, unclassified Aquificeae comprised a significant
        part of the bacterial population. Thus, we showed that the hottest of the

        where Bacteria represent a significant part of the microbial community, and
        planktonic and sediment populations differ in both composition and function.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10876-015-0920-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10876-015-0920-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10876-015-0920-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10876-015-0920-8\"}],\"title\":\"Preparation,

        are saturated hydrocarbons that are ubiquitous in the environment. Microbial

        films. In this work, three-layer films based on plasticized wheat gluten films
        have been developed by applying a more hydrophobic electrospun polyhydroxyalkanoate
        layers on both sides of the protein film. A commercial polyhydroxybutyrate

        content (PHBV3) have been used. The morphology, oxygen and water vapour barriers,
        the optical properties as well as the mechanical performance have been characterized.
        The effect of film processing temperature (145 and 160\_\xB0C) and the amount
        of electrospun material constituting the outer layers played an important
        role on the final physicochemical properties of these films. The results showed

        (PHAs) instead of the temperature used. The lowest water vapour permeability

        plays an important role in shaping ecological communities in human-related
        ecosystems. Although myriad studies have explored the joint effect of grazing
        and climate on plant communities, this interactive effect has rarely been
        studied in animals. We hypothesized that the effect of grazing on the reptile
        community varies along a climatic gradient in relation to the effect of grazing
        on habitat characteristics, and that grazing differentially affects reptiles
        of different biogeographic regions. We tested our hypotheses by collecting
        data on environmental characteristics and by trapping reptiles in four heterogeneous
        landscapes experiencing differing grazing intensities and distributed along
        a sharp climatic gradient. We found that while reptile diversity increased
        with grazing intensity at the mesic end of the gradient, it decreased with
        grazing intensity at the arid end. Moreover, the proportion of reptile species
        of differing biogeographic origins varied with the interactive effect of climate
        and grazing. The representation of species originating in arid biogeographic
        zones was highest at the arid end of the climatic gradient, and representation
        increased with grazing intensity within this area. Regardless of the climatic
        context, increased grazing pressure results in a reduction in vegetation cover
        and thus in changes in habitat characteristics. By reducing vegetation cover,
        grazing increased habitat heterogeneity in the dense mesic sites and decreased

        red mineral pigment known as cinnabar (HgS) was commonly employed in Roman
        fresco wall paintings. Fresco artists of the period favored this pigment for
        its striking red color. However, upon excavation and exposure to air and light,
        cinnabar-pigmented surfaces recovered from archaeological contexts often proved
        to be unstable. Mural paintings colored with cinnabar that have been exposed
        in the open air frequently demonstrate a disfiguring, irreversible darkening
        of the surface. Traditionally, scholars have attributed this alteration to
        a light-induced phase change from red \u03B1-cinnabar to black \u03B2-cinnabar
        (meta-cinnabar). While this transformation has not been totally excluded,
        the prevailing view among conservation scientists is that chlorine plays a
        key role in the darkening process through the formation of light-sensitive
        mercury chloride compounds, or as a catalyst in the photochemical redox of
        Hg(II)S into Hg(0) and S(0). Using laboratory-based experiments and thermodynamic
        modeling, this paper attempts to further clarify the mechanism(s) and kinetics
        of cinnabar alteration in fresco applications, especially the role of light,
        humidity, and chlorine ions. Additionally, it explores possible pathways and
        preventive as well as remedial conservation treatments during or immediately
        following excavation, to inhibit or retard darkening of cinnabar-pigmented

        relationship between different types of innovation is analysed from three
        different approaches. On the one hand, the distinctive view assumes that the
        determinants of each type of innovation are different and therefore there
        is no relationship between them. On the other hand, the integrative view considers
        that the different types of innovation are complementary. Finally, the product\u2013process
        matrix framework suggests that the relationship between product innovation
        and process innovation is substitutive. Using data from Spain belonging to
        the Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC) for the years 2008, 2009, 2010,
        2011 and 2012, we tested which of the three approaches is predominant. To
        perform the hypothesis test, we used the so-called complementarity approach.
        We find that there is no unique relation. The nature of the relationship depends
        on the types of innovation that interact. Our most significant finding is
        that the relationship between product innovation and process innovation is
        complementary. This finding contradicts the proposal of the product\u2013process

        are predicted to play fundamental roles in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular
        carcinoma (HCC). MiR-375 is frequently downregulated in HCC and acts as a
        tumor suppressor by targeting multiple oncogenes. The objective of this study
        was to evaluate miR-375 expression and its relevance to the prognosis of HCC.
        MiR-375 expression was measured in cancerous tissues using qRT-PCR and dichotomized
        based on a median cutoff. The association between miR-375 expression and clinicopathological
        parameters and prognosis was subsequently determined. Expression levels of
        miR-375 were detected in a cohort of 38 HCC patients who underwent curative
        surgery. No significant correlations were observed between miR-375 expression
        and clinicopathological parameters, such as gender, age, performance status,
        preoperative serum AFP level, histological grade, HBV-DNA copy number, ascites,
        cirrhosis, tumor size, number of tumor nodules, and macrovascular invasion.
        However, miR-375 expression differs across CLIP scores significantly ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.05).
        A trend toward poorer disease-free survival (DFS) was observed in patients
        with lower miR-375 expression compared to those with higher miR-375 expression
        ( p \u2009=\u20090.307). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low miR-375
        expression was an independent prognostic predictor for progression ( p \u2009=\u20090.032,
        risk ratio 3.273). Subgroup analysis revealed that low expression of miR-375
        was significantly associated with adverse DFS in patients with poorly differentiated

        is found that the following sequence of phase transformation takes place upon
        slow heating in annealed U-2\_wt\_pct Zr alloy: \u03B1 \_+\_ \u03B1 \u2032\_+\_
        \u03B4 -UZr_2\_\u2192\_ \u03B1 \_+\_ \u03B3 _2\_\u2192\_ \u03B2 \_+\_ \u03B3

        10\_wt\_pct Zr, the additional presence of a miscibility gap ( \u03B3 _1 U-rich
        bcc\_+\_ \u03B3 _2 Zr-rich bcc) in the high-temperature \u03B3 (bcc) phase
        region resulted in the following transformation sequence: \u03B1 \_+\_ \u03B1
        \u2032\_+\_ \u03B4 -UZr_2\_\u2192\_ \u03B1 \_+\_ \u03B3 _2\_\u2192\_ \u03B2
        \_+\_ \u03B3 _2\_\u2192\_ \u03B3 _1\_+\_ \u03B3 _2\_\u2192\_ \u03B3 . Further,
        it has been demonstrated that depending on the nature of starting microstructure,
        namely whether it is \u03B1 _eq\_+\_ \u03B4 -UZr_2, or a mix of \u03B1 \u2032\_+\_
        \u03B1 _eq\_+\_ \u03B4 -UZr_2 phases, the relative extents of two possible
        co-occurring modes of the first on-heating phase transformation step differ.
        In case of starting microstructure having mixture of three phases \u03B1 \u2032\_+\_
        \u03B1 _eq\_+\_ \u03B4 -UZr_2, it is found that \u03B1 \u2032-martensite relaxation
        via \u03B1 \u2032\_+\_ \u03B1 _eq\_+\_ \u03B4 -UZr_2\_\u2192\_ \u03B1 _eq\_+\_
        \u03B4 -UZr_2 constitutes the first on-heating thermal response. The \u03B1
        \u2032-martensitic relaxation is very closely followed by the dissolution
        of \u03B4 -UZr_2. The co-occurrence of these two events gives rise to a composite
        thermal arrest in a normal dynamic calorimetry profile. However, if the starting
        microstructure is the one having the equilibrium mix of \u03B1 _eq and \u03B4
        -UZr_2, then only the peritectoidal dissolution of \u03B4 -UZr_2 is found
        in the calorimetry profile. Unless, a very slow cooling rate of the order
        of 0.1\_K\_min^\u22121 is adopted from high-temperature \u03B3 (bcc) phase,
        it is not possible to obtain 100\_pct of \u03B1 _eq phase along with equilibrium
        amount of \u03B4 -UZr_2. At normal and high cooling rates, it is possible
        to suppress the diffusional decomposition of \u03B3 to varying extents. The
        direct \u03B3 \_\u2192\_ \u03B1 \u2032-martensite transformation has been
        observed at sufficiently higher cooling rates. It has been also noticed that
        even after \u03B3 \_\u2192\_ \u03B1 \u2032-martensite transformation the precipitation
        of \u03B4 -UZr_2 phase is possible at lower temperature during non-isothermal
        cooling. Further, the critical cooling rate required for \u03B3 \_\u2192\_
        \u03B1 \u2032 displacive transformation is found to decrease with increasing
        Zr content. For U-2, 5, and 10\_wt\_pct Zr alloys, it is found to be of the
        order of, 60, 20, 10\_K\_min^\u22121, respectively. The cooling rate from
        high-temperature \u03B3 (bcc) is found have a strong influence on microstructure
        evolution as well. The kinetic aspects of \u03B1 \_\u2192\_ \u03B2 diffusional
        transformation that occurs on heating have been modeled in terms of Kolmogorov\u2013Johnson\u2013Mehl\u2013Avrami
        formalism, and it is found that the transformation is effectively controlled

        at 50\xB0C. The redox polymerization was carried out at varied dosages of
        redox concentration; the lowest dosage of 0.3% was sufficient to achieve ~100%

        The other important property of the latexes is their freeze\u2013thaw (F\u2013T)
        stability. Even though ~100% conversion was achieved at 0.3% redox initiator

        is a young country in the Asia-Pacific region with a high maternal mortality
        rate of 557 per 100,000 live births. As most maternal deaths can be prevented
        by providing quality antenatal care (ANC) and skilled assistance during childbirth,
        understanding the barriers to the utilization of ANC services can enhance
        program implementation. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and
        factors associated with the under-utilization of ANC services in Timor-Leste.MethodsTimor-Leste
        Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS) 2009\u20132010 was a nationally representative
        multi-stage cross-sectional study involving 11,463 households and 9,828 childbirths.
        Information on last born child was recorded for 5,895 mother-child pairs.
        Factors influencing under-utilization of ANC were assessed using hierarchical
        logistic regression analysis.ResultsOnly 3311 (55.2, 95 % confidence interval
        (CI) 53.1 to 57.3 %) made the recommended four ANC visits, while 2584 (44.8;
        95 % CI 42.7 to 46.9 %) of them reported attending three or less ANC services.
        Significant factors positively associated with the under-utilization of ANC
        were low wealth status (odds ratio (OR) 2.09; 95 % CI 1.68 to 2.60), no maternal
        education (OR 1.54; 95 % CI 1.30 to 1.82) or primary maternal education (OR
        1.21; 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.41), no paternal education (OR 1.34; 95 % CI 1.13
        to 1.60), and having a big problem in permission to visit health facility
        (OR 1.65; 95 % CI 1.39 to 1.96).ConclusionsDespite the apparently good progress
        made in re-establishing the healthcare infrastructure, 45 % of mothers remained
        in need of a focused intervention to increase their use of ANC services. Further
        prenatal care program should pay attention to women with low wealth status
        and those and their partners who are uneducated. Moreover, women should be
        encouraged to make decision on their own health.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13595-015-0514-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13595-015-0514-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13595-015-0514-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-015-0514-5\"}],\"title\":\"Total

        messageContent and type of extractives vary considerably among woody species
        in the Congo Basin tropical forest. They influence the natural durability
        of wood with respect to fungal and insect degradation. Species containing
        higher amounts of extractives and Klason lignin were generally less susceptible
        to fungal colonization. Phenolic extractives with large anti-fungal and high
        antioxidant activities were the main chemical family of compounds extracted
        from the tested species, which suggests a potential chemical valorization
        of these extractives.ContextSeveral woody species from the Congo Basin are
        known for their natural durability, but the causes of this natural durability
        are not always fully elucidated. This is particularly the case for the resistance
        to white rotting fungi decay.AimsThe chemical composition as well as the antioxidant
        activity of the heartwood extractives of several species were quantified and
        correlated to the ability of different fungi to colonize wood sawdusts in
        order to better understand their decay resistance.MethodsThe chemical screening
        of extracts was conducted using colorimetric methods. The quantity of lignin,
        extracts and total phenolic compounds, as well as antioxidant activities were
        determined. Extracted and unextracted heartwood sawdusts were exposed to two
        white rot fungi to assess the effect of extractives on their colonization.ResultsExtractives
        and lignin contents ranged from 2.7 to 16.0\_% and from 26.5 to 35.9\_%, respectively.
        Antioxidant activity was directly connected to total phenolic contents. The
        phytochemical screening revealed the presence of different chemical groups
        in all extracts. Resistance to fungi was correlated to the amount of extractives
        and in most cases to the lignin content.ConclusionPhenolic compounds associated

        situ burning is a method by which oil is burned at a spill site under controlled
        conditions, and this method is subject to increased interest due to its applicability
        in the Arctic. This paper reviews the literature regarding the characterization
        and environmental effects of burn residues in Arctic waters. The results of
        a systematic literature search indicate that only a very limited number of
        studies have arctic pertinence. From the review, it is also indicated that
        the properties and composition of the residues depend on the efficiency of
        the burning and the oil type. Furthermore, the studies within the frame of
        the literature search reach consensus that in situ burning may increase the
        concentrations of large poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; high ring number)
        while reducing small PAHs (low ring number). There are very few toxicity studies
        of burn residues on aquatic and arctic organisms, and to enhance the knowledge

        is a lack of studies investigating the potential effect of sinking burn residues
        on benthic organism and the smothering effects of the more viscous burn residues
        on birds and other organisms related to the sea surface. More knowledge regarding

        resistance in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans poses significant challenges
        for its antibiotic treatment. The conformational change of the target enzyme
        14 alpha-demethylase (Erg11p) due to ERG11 gene mutations is one of the mechanisms
        resulting in the azole resistance. ERG11 of 23 isolates (8 susceptible and
        15 resistant) and 6 standard strains of Candida albicans were amplified and
        sequenced. Nineteen missense mutations were detected. Two mutations, G487T
        (A114S) and T916C (Y257H), coexisted exclusively in 14 fluconazole-resistant
        isolates. To identify the resistance mechanisms in the isolates with G487T
        and T916C mutations, we compared the expression of 5 resistance-related genes
        in the 14 azole-resistant isolates with those in the susceptible type strain
        ATCC 10231, Saccharomyces cerevisiae AD/CDR1 and AD/CDR2 . The tested values
        of mRNA transcription of CDR1 and CDR2 were higher than that of control strain,
        while the semi-quantified Cdr1p values were not higher in all of the 14 resistant
        isolates. And the data analyzed with t test suggest that both of the differences
        are significant ( P \_\\u003c\_0.0005) when the resistant isolates are considered
        as a whole. Cdr2p was up-regulated in 5 isolates, and down-regulated or even
        undetectable in the remaining 9 isolates. The transcription of ERG11 , MDR1
        , and FLU1 varied in these isolates. These data suggested that overexpression
        of the five genes might not be the reason of resistance in the 14 isolates
        with G487T and T916C, especially in the 5 isolates (GZ09, GZ15, GZ16, GZ58,
        and 4263) in which neither translation of Cdr1p/Cdr2p nor transcription of
        ERG11 , MDR1 , or FLU1 was detected up-regulated. The results suggest that
        Erg11p conformational change due to the point mutations is most likely responsible
        for the azole resistance in these isolates.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10883-015-9296-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10883-015-9296-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10883-015-9296-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10883-015-9296-1\"}],\"title\":\"Tangent

        japonica remains a major public health problem in China. Integrating molecular
        analyses, such as population genetic analyses, of the parasite into the on-going
        surveillance programs is helpful in exploring the factors causing the persistence
        and/or spread of Schistosoma japonicum . However, genotyping errors can seriously
        affect the results of such studies, unless accounted for in the analyses.MethodsWe
        assessed the genotyping errors (missing alleles or false alleles) of seven
        S. japonicum microsatellites, using a pedigree data approach for schistosome
        miracidia, which were stored on Whatman FTA cards.ResultsAmong 107 schistosome
        miracidia successfully genotyped, resulting in a total of 715 loci calls,
        a total of 31 genotyping errors were observed with 25.2\_% of the miracidia
        having at least one error. The error rate per locus differed among loci, which
        ranged from 0 to 9.8\_%, with the mean error rate 4.3\_% over loci. With the
        parentage analysis software Cervus, the assignment power with these seven
        markers was estimated to be 89.5\_% for one parent and 99.9\_% for a parent
        pair. One locus was inferred to have a high number of null alleles and a second
        with a high mistyping rate.ConclusionTo the authors\u2019 knowledge, this
        is the first time that S. japonicum pedigrees have been used in an assessment
        of genotyping errors of microsatellite markers. The observed locus-specific
        error rate will benefit downstream epidemiological or ecological analyses
        of S. japonicum with the markers.\"}],\"facets\":[{\"name\":\"subject\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"Medicine

        mass spectrometric techniques (THM\u2013Py\u2013GCMS, DTMS and ESI\u2013MS)
        have been used to characterize the organic fraction of early twentieth century
        oil-based enamel paints. Analysis has been carried out on dry and liquid samples
        from historical reference paints, and on color swatches from commercial paint
        brochures, with a special focus on Ripolin. This renowned French brand of
        enamel paints, manufactured for household and other uses since 1897, was reportedly
        used by many avant-garde artists. Confirming the presence of enamel paint
        such as Ripolin in early twentieth century artworks scientifically through
        binding medium analysis is challenging because, until the end of the Second
        World War, the most widely used house paints were oil-based and chemically
        similar to artists\u2019 oil paints. In addition, artists often modified/reformulated
        materials including oils, driers, industrial and house paints to customize
        their handling and optical properties. The challenge of identifying oil-based
        enamel paints on the basis of chemical composition is illustrated by the analysis
        of samples from two paintings by Wassily Kandinsky and Pablo Picasso.ResultsAnalysis
        demonstrated that the organic fraction of Ripolin paints is typically composed
        of heat-bodied linseed oil in mixture with variable amounts of diterpene (Pinaceae)
        resin, in accordance with the industrial technical literature of the time.
        Comparative analyses of Lefranc artists\u2019 tube paints suggested a more
        variable composition with respect to the type(s) of oil and their pre-treatment,
        and showed the presence of Pinaceae resin at trace levels only in two cases.
        Beeswax was detected in one of the tube paints tested.ConclusionsThe results
        of this study indicate that complementary information can be obtained from
        the study of liquid paint from cans and dried paint-outs, while the media
        of painted brochures may differ from the original formulation as those were
        designed for expediency of drying and aesthetics. The results also elucidate
        how formulations and processing technology influence the physical and drying
        properties of oil-based enamel paints, in comparison with contemporary artists\u2019
        oil tube paints. Further research on a broader range of reference materials
        should help in the development of refined strategies for characterizing oil-based
        paints from the early twentieth century. Graphical abstract: Ripolin enamel

        in Zhejiang Province. AS patients were selected, diagnosed, and confirmed

        were compared with all subjects. Genotypes for eight selected single nucleotide

        findings cognitive and emotional dysregulation in depression and psychiatric
        disorders may be related to deficits in inhibitory functions and temporo-limbic
        seizure-like activity due to specific changes in neural dynamics and complexity
        of neural networks.MethodsIn order to evaluate the clinical utility of nonlinear
        analysis of EEG complexity (measured by Lyapunov exponents) and to assess
        underlying epileptiform changes, we studied a sample of 19 depressive patients
        including nine depressive patients with episodic sharp-wave EEG abnormalities
        and ten depressive patients without any abnormalities, and compared also subgroups
        of these patients who used benzodiazepine medication to assess its influence
        on EEG complexity.Results and findingsThe results show that the depressive
        patients with episodic sharp-wave EEG abnormalities had significantly lower
        EEG complexity than the control groups of patients. The data also indicate
        that benzodiazepines significantly influence neural complexity and increase
        it in the subgroup of patients with sharp wave abnormalities, and on the other
        hand decrease the level of complexity in the control subgroup of depressive
        patients.ConclusionsIn agreement with other findings results of this study
        suggest that sharp waves or other underlying epileptiform EEG abnormalities
        related to abnormal neural excitability and disturbances in brain inhibitory

        iron (ZVI) in series, and the MMT slurry was respectively injected into them
        to form reactive zones. The results showed that for tank A, total arsenic

        of herbaceous species and BSCs are rarely discussed during the process of
        vegetation restoration of anthropogenically damaged areas in these regions.
        In this study, the herbaceous plant species composition, along with the BSCs
        coverage and thicknesses, was investigated at six different re-vegetation
        type sites, and the natural vegetation site of the Heidaigou open pit coal
        mine in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was used as a reference.
        The highest total species richness (16), as well as the species richness (4.4),
        occurred in the Tree and Herbaceous vegetation type site. The species composition
        similarities between the restored sites and the reference site were shown
        to be very low, and ranged from 0.09 to 0.42. Also, among the restored sites,
        the similarities of the species were fairly high and similar, and ranged from
        0.45 to 0.93. The density and height of the re-vegetated woody plants were
        significantly correlated with the indexes of the diversity of the species.
        The Shrub vegetation type site showed the greatest total coverage (80\_%)
        of BSCs and algae crust coverage (48\_%). The Shrub and Herbaceous type had
        the greatest thicknesses of BSCs, with as much as 3.06\_mm observed, which
        was followed by 2.64\_mm for the Shrub type. There was a significant correlation
        observed between the coverage of the total BSCs, and the total vegetation
        and herbaceous vegetation coverage, as well as between the algae crust coverage
        and the herbaceous vegetation coverage. It has been suggested that the re-vegetated
        dwarf woody plant species (such as shrubs and semi-shrubs) should be chosen
        for the optimal methods of the restoration of herbaceous species diversity
        at dumping sites, and these should be planted with low density. Furthermore,

        quantity and quality of skeletal muscle is required to maintain lifespan and
        healthspan into older age. The concept of skeletal muscle programming/memory
        has been suggested to contribute to accelerated muscle decline in the elderly
        in association with early life stress such as fetal malnutrition. Further,
        muscle cells in vitro appear to remember the in vivo environments from which
        they are derived (e.g. cancer, obesity, type II diabetes, physical inactivity
        and nutrient restriction). Tumour-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03B1) is a
        pleiotropic cytokine that is chronically elevated in sarcopenia and cancer
        cachexia. Higher TNF-\u03B1 levels are strongly correlated with muscle loss,
        reduced strength and therefore morbidity and earlier mortality. We have extensively
        shown that TNF-\u03B1 impairs regenerative capacity in mouse and human muscle
        derived stem cells [Meadows et al. (J Cell Physiol 183(3):330\u2013337, 2000

        2010 )]. We have also recently established an epigenetically mediated mechanism
        (SIRT1-histone deacetylase) regulating survival of myoblasts in the presence
        of TNF-\u03B1 [Saini et al. (Exp Physiol 97(3):400\u2013418, 2012 )]. We therefore
        wished to extend this work in relation to muscle memory of catabolic stimuli
        and the potential underlying epigenetic modulation of muscle loss. To enable
        this aim; C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in the absence or presence of early
        TNF-\u03B1 (early proliferative lifespan) followed by 30 population doublings
        in the absence of TNF-\u03B1, prior to the induction of differentiation in
        low serum media (LSM) in the absence or presence of late TNF-\u03B1 (late
        proliferative lifespan). The cells that received an early plus late lifespan
        dose of TNF-\u03B1 exhibited reduced morphological (myotube number) and biochemical
        (creatine kinase activity) differentiation vs. control cells that underwent
        the same number of proliferative divisions but only a later life encounter
        with TNF-\u03B1. This suggested that muscle cells had a morphological memory
        of the acute early lifespan TNF-\u03B1 encounter. Importantly, methylation
        of myoD CpG islands were increased in the early TNF-\u03B1 cells, 30 population
        doublings later, suggesting that even after an acute encounter with TNF-\u03B1,
        the cells have the capability of retaining elevated methylation for at least
        30 cellular divisions. Despite these fascinating findings, there were no further
        increases in myoD methylation or changes in its gene expression when these
        cells were exposed to a later TNF-\u03B1 dose suggesting that this was not
        directly responsible for the decline in differentiation observed. In conclusion,
        data suggest that elevated myoD methylation is retained throughout muscle
        cells proliferative lifespan as result of early life TNF-\u03B1 treatment
        and has implications for the epigenetic control of muscle\_loss.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s13075-015-0739-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s13075-015-0739-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13075-015-0739-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13075-015-0739-6\"}],\"title\":\"\\n

        stability in VLPO is unknown. The aim of this study was to compare 75 to 100\_%
        distal screw lengths in VLPO.MethodsA biomechanical study was conducted on
        11 paired fresh-frozen radii. HRpQCT scans were performed to assess bone mineral
        density (BMD)\_and\_bone mineral content (BMC). The specimens were randomized
        pair-wise into two groups: 100\_% (group A) and 75\_% (group B) unicortical
        distal screw lengths. A validated fracture model for extra-articular distal
        radius fractures (AO-23 A3) was used. Polyaxial volar locking plates were
        mounted, and distal screws was inserted using a drill guide block. For group
        A, the distal screw tips were intended to be flush or just short of the dorsal
        cortex. In group B, a target screw length of 75\_% was calculated. The specimens
        were tested to failure using a displacement-controlled axial compression test.
        Primary biomechanical stability was assessed by stiffness, elastic limit,
        and maximum force as well as with residual tilt, which quantified plastic
        deformation.ResultsNine specimens were tested successfully. BMD and BMC did
        not differ between the two groups. The mean distal screw length of group A
        was 21.7\u2009\xB1\u20092.6\_mm (range: 16 to 26\_mm), for group B 16.9\u2009\xB1\u20091.9\_mm
        (range: 12 to 20\_mm). Distal screws in group B were on average 5.6\u2009\xB1\u20090.9\_mm
        (range: 3 to 7\_mm) shorter than measured. No significant differences were
        found for stiffness (706\u2009\xB1\u2009103\_N/mm vs. 660\u2009\xB1\u2009124\_N/mm),
        elastic limit (177\u2009\xB1\u200925\_N vs. 167\u2009\xB1\u200936\_N), maximum
        force (493\u2009\xB1\u2009139\_N vs. 471\u2009\xB1\u2009149\_N), or residual
        tilt (7.3\xB0\u2009\xB1\u20090.7\xB0 vs. 7.1\xB0\u2009\xB1\u20091.3\xB0).ConclusionThe
        75\_% distal screw length in VLPO provides similar primary stability to 100\_%
        unicortical screw length. This study, for the first time, provides the biomechanical
        basis to choose distal screws significantly shorter then measured.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/112_2015_24\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/112_2015_24\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/112_2015_24\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/112_2015_24\"}],\"title\":\"The

        are conventionally regarded as an extension of the small intestinal absorptive
        surface, but they are also, as latterly discovered, a launching pad for brush
        border digestive enzymes. Recent work has demonstrated that motor elements
        of the microvillus cytoskeleton operate to displace the apical membrane toward
        the apex of the microvillus, where it vesiculates and is shed into the periapical
        space. Catalytically active brush border digestive enzymes remain incorporated
        within the membranes of these vesicles, which shifts the site of BB digestion
        from the surface of the enterocyte to the periapical space. This process enables
        nutrient hydrolysis to occur adjacent to the membrane in a pre-absorptive
        step. The characterization of BB digestive enzymes is influenced by the way
        in which these enzymes are anchored to the apical membranes of microvilli,
        their subsequent shedding in membrane vesicles, and their differing susceptibilities
        to cleavage from the component membranes. In addition, the presence of active
        intracellular components of these enzymes complicates their quantitative assay

        findings, family or personal domain, working time and psychosocial working
        conditions, job-related well-being and other career-related aspects. Gender

        These deaths are often not analyzed sincerely as they are not institutional

        to death.MethodPatients brought dead to casualty were seen by the doctors
        on duty in Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,Gandhi Medical College,
        Bhopal round the clock. Cause of death was analyzed by verbal autopsy of attendants
        and referral letter from the institute. In this analytical study a complete

        However, a major limitation of existing nanomanipulation systems is the constrained
        motion and maneuver of the probe. In this paper, we propose a new design of
        an AFM probe suitable for nanomanipulation. The design relies on active elements
        that improve the sensing and actuation capabilities of the AFM as a nanomanipulator.
        In addition, a piezopatch is attached to the cantilever to be able to tune
        its stiffness in situ. Design considerations and path tracking performance
        of the proposed probe are analyzed.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13157-015-0694-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13157-015-0694-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13157-015-0694-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-015-0694-7\"}],\"title\":\"Testing

        cover estimates from fixed plots are often used for monitoring changes in
        wetland vegetation. However, while it is recognised that estimates can vary
        due to observer bias, vegetation height and differences in plot placement
        between surveys, the effects of this variability on power to detect change
        are rarely assessed. We used vegetation survey data from shrub swamps in the
        Blue Mountains, Australia, to quantify variability in visual cover estimates
        from these sources and how it affects power to detect change between surveys,
        at the swamp scale, using paired-sample t-tests. Key variables included total
        cover of live green vegetation, bare ground and open water and the proportional
        cover of native vs exotic and/or terrestrial vs amphibious species, pooled
        across multiple 1\_m^2 plots, per transect. Minimum detectable effect sizes

        vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) has been used not only for graft evaluation but
        also for graft reconditioning prior to lung transplantation. Inflammatory
        cells such as neutrophils may cause additional graft injury during EVLP. Neutrophil
        elastase inhibitors protect lungs against neutrophil-induced lung injury,
        such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. This study aimed to investigate
        the effect of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor during EVLP.MethodsEVLP was
        performed for 4\_h in bilateral pig lungs that had previously experienced
        warm ischemia for 2\_h with or without a neutrophil elastase inhibitor (treated
        and control groups, respectively; n \_=\_6). Following EVLP, the left lung
        was transplanted into a recipient pig, and this was followed by observation
        for 4\_h. Pulmonary functions were observed both during EVLP and during the
        early post-transplant stage.ResultsDuring EVLP, decreases in neutrophil elastase

        array-based transcriptome analysis was analyzed for subcutaneous white adipose
        tissue (WAT) from 11 obese and 9 never-obese women. Limma was used for statistical
        analysis.ResultsWe identified 5529 differentially methylated DNA sites (DMS)
        for 2223 differentially expressed genes between obese cases and never-obese
        controls (false discovery rate \\u003c5\_%). The 5529 DMS displayed a median

        were under-represented in CpG islands and in promoter regions, and over-represented

        In most cases, gene expression and DMS displayed reciprocal changes in obese
        women. Furthermore, among 99 candidate genes in genetic loci associated with
        body fat distribution in genome-wide association studies (GWAS); 22 genes

        cancer which have taken place over a period of time among women in Cancer
        Registries of India. Breast Cancer trends for invasive breast cancer in women
        in Indian Registries have varied during the selected period. Occurrence of
        breast cancers has also shown geographical variation in India.Materials and
        MethodsThis data was collected by means of a \u2018Standard Core Proforma\u2019
        designed by NCRP conforming to the data fields as suggested by International

        been an increase recorded in breast cancer in most of the registries, some
        of them have recorded an insignificant increase. Comparison of Age Adjusted
        Rates (AARs) among Indian Registries has been carried out after which trends

        indolylquinoline derivative, 3-((7-ethyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-methyl)-2-methylquinoline
        (EMMQ), inhibited the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells
        in dose- and time-dependent manners. The cytotoxicity was mediated through
        apoptotic cell death that began with mitochondrial membrane potential interruption
        and DNA damage. EMMQ caused transient elevation of p53 that assists in cytochrome
        c release, cleavage of downstream PARP and procaspase-3 and mitochondria-related
        apoptosis. The degree of apoptotic cell death depends on the status of tumor
        suppressor p53 of the target cells. H1299 cells with stable ectopic expression
        of p53 induced cytotoxicity by disrupting mitochondria functions that differed
        with those transfected with mutant p53 . Knocking-down of p53 attenuated drug
        effects. EMMQ suppressed the growth of A549 tumor cells in xenograft tumors
        by exhibiting apoptosis characteristics. Given its small molecular weight
        acting as an effective p53 regulator in NSCLC cells, EMMQ could be an addition
        to the current list of lung cancer treatment.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10773-015-2787-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10773-015-2787-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10773-015-2787-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10773-015-2787-8\"}],\"title\":\"Weak

        refers to the genetic material that can be extracted from bulk environmental
        samples such as soil, water, and even air. The rapidly expanding study of
        eDNA has generated unprecedented ability to detect species and conduct genetic
        analyses for conservation, management, and research, particularly in scenarios
        where collection of whole organisms is impractical or impossible. While the
        number of studies demonstrating successful eDNA detection has increased rapidly
        in recent years, less research has explored the \u201Cecology\u201D of eDNA\u2014myriad

        its influence on eDNA detection, quantification, analysis, and application

        the ecology of eDNA, including the origin, state, transport, and fate of extraorganismal
        genetic material. Using this framework, we review and synthesize the findings
        of eDNA studies from diverse environments, taxa, and fields of study to highlight
        important concepts and knowledge gaps in eDNA study and application. Additionally,
        we identify frontiers of conservation-focused eDNA application where we see
        the most potential for growth, including the use of eDNA for estimating population
        size, population genetic and genomic analyses via eDNA, inclusion of other
        indicator biomolecules such as environmental RNA or proteins, automated sample
        collection and analysis, and consideration of an expanded array of creative

        messageA 14\_bp deletion in CsACS2 gene encoding a truncated loss-of-function
        protein is responsible for elongated fruit shape and perfect flowers in cucumber.AbstractIn
        cucumber ( Cucumis sativus L.), sex expression and fruit shape are important
        components of biological and marketable yield. The association of fruit shape
        and sex expression is a very interesting phenomenon. The sex determination
        is controlled primarily by the F (female) and M (monoecy) loci. Homozygous
        recessive mm plants bear bisexual (perfect) flowers, and the fruits are often
        round shaped. CsACS2 encoding the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase
        has been shown to be the candidate gene for the m locus. We recently identified
        an andromonoecious cucumber line H38 that has bisexual flowers but elongated
        fruits. To rapidly clone this monoecious gene in H38, we developed a tri-parent
        mapping strategy, which took advantage of the high-density Gy14\_\xD7\_9930
        cucumber genetic map and the powder of bulk segregant analysis. Microsatellite
        markers from the Gy14\_\xD7\_9930 map were used to screen two pairs of unisexual
        and bisexual bulks constructed from H38\_\xD7\_Gy14 and H38\_\xD7\_9930 F_2
        populations. Polymorphic markers were identified and used to quickly develop
        a framework map and place the monoecious locus of H38 in cucumber chromosome
        1. Further fine mapping allowed identification of a novel allele, m - 1 ,
        at the monoecious locus to control the bisexual flower in H38, which was due
        to a 14\_bp deletion in the third exon of the CsACS2 gene encoding a truncated
        loss-of-function protein of the cucumber 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
        acid synthase. This new allele provides a valuable tool in understanding the
        molecular mechanisms of CsACS2 in the relationships of sex determination,
        fruit shape, and CsACS activities in cucumber.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10750-015-2443-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10750-015-2443-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10750-015-2443-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2443-6\"}],\"title\":\"Using

        tobacco-related mortality dwarfs that of all other drugs. Nicotine is believed
        to be the primary agent responsible for tobacco use and addiction. However,
        nicotine is a relatively weak and inconsistent reinforcer in nonhumans and
        nicotine reinforcement has not been demonstrated in never-smokers.ObjectivesThis
        study investigated the discriminative, subjective, and reinforcing effects
        of nicotine in never-smokers.MethodsEighteen never-smokers (\\u003c50 lifetime
        nicotine exposures) participated in a double-blind study. During a drug discrimination
        phase, volunteers ingested oral nicotine and placebo capsules (quasi-random
        order) at least 2\_h apart and rated subjective effects repeatedly for 2\_h
        after ingestion in daily sessions. Blocks of 10 sessions were continued until
        significant discrimination was achieved ( p \u2009\u2264\u20090.05, binomial
        test; \u22658 of 10). Following discrimination, nicotine choice was tested
        by having volunteers choose which capsule set to ingest on each daily session.
        Successive blocks of 10 sessions were conducted until choice for nicotine
        or placebo met significance within each volunteer (\u22658 of 10 sessions).ResultsAll
        18 volunteers significantly discriminated nicotine from placebo; the lowest
        dose discriminated ranged from 1.0 to 4.0\_mg/70\_kg. Nine volunteers significantly
        chose nicotine (choosers) and nine significantly chose placebo (nicotine avoiders).
        The choosers reported predominately positive nicotine subjective effects (e.g.,
        alert/attentive, good effects, liking), while avoiders tended to report negative
        effects (e.g., dizzy, upset stomach, disliking). Both choosers and avoiders
        attributed their choice to the qualitative nature of drug effects.ConclusionsThese
        results provide the first evidence that nicotine can function as a reinforcer

        of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2014 has highlighted a number
        of spectacular advances of the past couple of years for T cell lymphomas.
        These lymphomas are probably the most challenging of all types of hematologic
        malignancies: First, patients usually present in a very ill condition and
        in a very advanced stage of disease; second, they do not respond well to chemotherapy;
        and third, T cell lymphomas are rare diseases. They account for only 15\u2009%
        of all cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and with more than 15 subtypes any subtype
        is very rare [ 1 ]. Therefore, it requires joint forces of an international
        community to make advances in the understanding of the disease and to identify
        new treatment approaches. Another reason why the prognosis of T cell lymphomas
        has been dismal compared with its counterparts in B cell lymphomas is that
        historically we have applied the therapies from B cell lymphomas to T cell
        lymphomas. With the advances of large international preclinical studies, we
        now recognize that the paradigms we learned for B cell lymphomas are inappropriate
        for T cell lymphomas. An evolving basic science literature suggests that T
        cell lymphomas are highly enriched for various mutations involving epigenetic
        operations [ 2 - 5 ]. This might explain why T cell lymphomas are so uniquely
        poised to be sensitive to the class of epigenetic drugs such as histone deacetylase
        inhibitors.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s40830-015-0032-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40830-015-0032-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40830-015-0032-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40830-015-0032-1\"}],\"title\":\"Deformation

        The Author(s)\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractSince the nuclear accident
        in Fukushima the European electricity economy has been in transition. The
        ongoing shut down of nuclear power plants and the widespread installation
        of wind power and photovoltaic generation capacities, especially in Germany,
        has led to a high share of intermittent renewable electricity production.
        This high amount of generation with very little variable cost has led to a
        significant decline of the prices at the European energy exchange. This has
        meant that many thermal power plants are no longer able to work economically
        and have already been shut down, although they would be needed in times of
        high demands and as backup capacities. Therefore, a redesign of the European
        electricity market is needed and in order to find out the right characteristics
        and effects of such a redesign pre-investigations based on simulation models
        are reasonable. This paper introduces ATLANTIS, which is a simulation model
        of the European electricity economy and covers technical as well as economic
        and environmental issues and allows the calculation of different scenarios
        up to 2050 and even beyond regarding the specific characteristics of the electricity
        economy. After a comprehensive introduction of the model some example applications
        and an outlook are presented.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12237-015-0030-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12237-015-0030-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12237-015-0030-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-015-0030-8\"}],\"title\":\"Landward

        investigate the evolution of the salt field in a bar-built estuary after the
        tidal inlet is closed by sediment, isolating the estuary from the ocean. We
        show that seawater trapped by inlet closure in the Russian River Estuary,
        CA, undergoes a two-stage landward intrusion process that leads to widespread
        salt stratification throughout the estuary. This salinity intrusion extends
        to distances of several kilometers from the beach\u2014into the \u201Cinner
        estuary\u201D that is separated from the \u201Couter estuary\u201D by shallow
        sills and typically devoid of saline waters during tidal conditions when the
        mouth is open. We describe landward movement of saline waters during six closure
        events in 2009 and 2010, based on repeat boat-based conductivity-temperature-depth
        (CTD) surveys and bottom-mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs).
        While sills block the initial landward motion of dense saline waters due to
        gravitational adjustment (first stage of intrusion), these same sills facilitate
        a wind-induced, one-direction valve mechanism through which saline waters
        are pumped into the inner estuary. Saline waters that crest the shallow sill
        can drain into deeper pools in the inner estuary as a pulsed gravity current
        (second stage of intrusion). We use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis
        to identify an internal seiche in the outer estuary that results in uplift
        of pycnocline waters during the night at the boundary to the inner estuary.
        EOF analysis of inner estuary currents and a horizontal Richardson number
        are used to suggest that nocturnal gravity current events in the inner estuary
        (beyond the blocking sill) occur as pulses initiated by the internal seiche
        in the outer estuary.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00586-015-4230-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00586-015-4230-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00586-015-4230-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00586-015-4230-5\"}],\"title\":\"Unilateral

        were tested under various segment conditions: native (NAT), laminoplasty (LP),
        laminoplasty with unilateral (LPU) or bilateral (LPB) stabilization, laminectomy
        with bilateral stabilization (LCB), and laminectomy. The instrumented level
        was from C3 to C6. For each segment condition, in vitro flexibility tests
        were performed using a spinal simulator and an applied load of \xB12.5 Nm.
        The three-dimensional kinematics of the entire cervical segment in three main
        loading directions [flexion\u2013extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and
        axial rotation (AR)] was measured with an ultrasonic motion analysis system.
        Analysis of variance followed by a post hoc test was used to determine differences
        under the specific segment conditions to assess the parameters range of motion
        (ROM) and neutral zone (NZ).ResultsFor FE, the total ROM of laminoplasty (\u22126.3\_%

        \_\\u003e\_0.38). The same results were found with LB. For AR, the stabilization
        of all instrumentations was less pronounced, but had the same tendency seen
        for FE and AR. The results for the NZ showed equivalent values as that for
        ROM.ConclusionThe degree of stabilization was as expected for LC and LCB;
        namely, no stabilization for LC and maximal stabilization for LCB. LPU exhibited
        almost the same degree of stabilization as LCB. LPU could be a new treatment

        high and moderate risk alleles have been identified for breast and ovarian
        cancer predisposition and most of them encode proteins that function in DNA
        repair. A prospective candidate for breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility
        is the HELQ helicase that has a role in the resolution of DNA interstrand
        cross-links. HELQ interacts with the RAD51 paralog complex BCDX2. Two components
        of the complex, RAD51C and RAD51D, increase the risk of ovarian cancer especially,
        and the other two, RAD51B and XRCC2 have been associated with breast cancer
        risk. To investigate the role of HELQ in cancer predisposition, we screened
        the gene for germline variation in 185 Finnish breast or ovarian cancer families
        and performed haplotype analyses for 1517 breast cancer cases, 308 ovarian
        cancer cases, and 1234 population controls using five common polymorphisms
        at the HELQ gene locus. No truncating mutations were identified among the

        identified but no additional carriers were observed in the subsequent genotyping
        of 332 familial breast or ovarian cancer patients. Furthermore, the haplotype
        distribution did not differ between breast or ovarian cancer cases and population
        controls. Our results indicate that HELQ is not a major breast and ovarian
        cancer susceptibility gene in the Finnish population. However, we cannot rule
        out rare risk-variants in the Finnish or other populations and larger datasets
        are needed to further assess the role of HELQ especially in ovarian cancer

        post translational modification of lysine acetylation is a key mechanism that
        regulates chromatin structure. Epigenetic readers, such as the BET domains,
        are responsible for reading histone lysine acetylation which is a hallmark
        of open chromatin structure, further providing a scaffold that can be accessed
        by RNA polymerases as well as transcription factors. Recently, several reports
        have assessed and highlighted the roles of epigenetic readers in various cellular
        contexts. However, little is known about their role in the regulation of inflammatory
        genes, which is critical in exquisitely tuning inflammatory responses to a
        variety of immune stimuli. In this study, we investigated the role of epigenetic
        readers BRD2 and BRD4 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune responses
        in mouse primary astrocytes. Inflammatory stimulation by LPS showed that the
        levels of Brd2 mRNA and protein were increased, while Brd4 mRNA levels did
        not change. Knocking down of Brd2 mRNA using specific small interfering RNA
        (siRNA) in cultured mouse primary astrocytes inhibited LPS-induced mRNA expression
        and secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). However, no other
        pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Il-6 , Il-1\u03B2 and Tnf-\u03B1, were
        affected. Indeed, treatment with bromodomain-containing protein inhibitor,
        JQ1, blocked Pai-1 mRNA expression through the inhibition of direct BRD2 protein-binding
        and active histone modification on Pai-1 promoter. Taken together, our data
        suggest that BRD2 is involved in the modulation of neuroinflammatory responses
        through PAI-1 and via the regulation of epigenetic reader BET protein, further
        providing a potential novel therapeutic strategy in neuroinflammatory diseases.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00362-015-0709-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00362-015-0709-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00362-015-0709-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00362-015-0709-8\"}],\"title\":\"Nonparametric

        recent years there has been a remarkable growth of multi-asset options. These
        options exhibit sensitivity to the volatility of the underlying assets, as
        well as to their correlations. The call versus call is a product commonly
        used to trade correlation within the inter-dealer broker markets. The buyer
        of correlation buys a European call on the equally weighted basket option
        and sells a weighted average of European calls on each asset. In this case,
        the following important question arises: Is the information provided by equally
        weighted basket options enough to price other European multi-asset exotic
        derivatives such as worst-of or outperformance options? This article investigates
        this issue under a stochastic correlation framework. Importantly, this article
        shows that, when pricing multi-asset exotic derivatives, matching the prices
        of European equally weighted basket options, quoted in the market, does not
        guaranty the absence of model risk even in the case where the exotic payoff
        is observed only at maturity.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12119-015-9317-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12119-015-9317-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12119-015-9317-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12119-015-9317-y\"}],\"title\":\"\u201CYou

        have to respond simultaneously to different environmental factors often making
        trade-offs between conflicting demands necessary. Many freshwater ecosystems
        are resource-limited and both intra- and interspecific competitiveness is
        a common requirement to gain and defend resources necessary for reproduction.
        Although predation risk is an important selective force affecting behavioral
        decisions, little is known about the impact of predation risk on interspecific
        competition. Here, we investigate whether chemically mediated predation risk
        affects interspecific territorial aggression by the freshwater cichlid Pelvicachromis
        taeniatus . In our experiments, territorial P. taeniatus males were visually
        confronted with a territorial intruder: a heterospecific, sympatric cichlid
        ( Benitochromis nigrodorsalis ) which generally induced aggression in P. taeniatus
        . Predation risk for P. taeniatus was simulated by a concurrent release of
        conspecific chemical alarm cues. In control treatments, no chemical cues,
        dissolved heterospecific alarm cues, or aliquots of distilled water were provided
        during these aggressive encounters. The results show that interspecific aggression
        of territorial male P. taeniatus is significantly decreased under predation
        risk compared to the control treatments. This suggests that interspecific
        competition becomes less intense under concurrent predation risk. As this
        process could hinder competitive exclusion, predation risk may indirectly
        promote and stabilize biodiversity in natural ecosystems.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3134-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3134-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3134-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11661-015-3134-7\"}],\"title\":\"The

        better understand the effects of cast defects on mechanical properties, cast
        aluminum alloys with various porosities were used. Porosity in the cast samples
        was created during the casting process, and to clearly identify the porosity
        effects on the mechanical properties, artificial defects (porosity-like tiny
        holes) were created mechanically. The tensile properties for the cast aluminum
        alloys appear to be attributed to the area fraction of the porosity on the
        fracture surface (namely, the defect rate, DR), although there were different
        trends because of the different stress concentrations: the ultimate tensile
        strength and 0.2\_pct proof strength were linearly related to DR, while a
        non-linear correlation was detected for fracture strain. Even in Al alloys
        with small amounts of defects, significant reductions in the fracture strain
        were observed. These results were verified using tensile tests on specimens
        containing artificial defects. The effects of artificial defects on the tensile
        properties were further investigated using numerous tiny holes, created in
        several formations. The artificial defects (several small holes), lined up
        at perpendicular (90\_deg) and 45\_deg directions against the loading direction,
        made significant reductions in the tensile properties, even though only weak
        defect effects were observed for the 90\_deg loading direction. No severe
        defect effects were obvious for the specimen with a tiny defect of \u03D50.1\_mm,
        because of the lower stress concentration, compared to the microstructural
        effects in the cast Al alloys: the grain boundaries and the second phases.
        Such phenomena were clarified using tensile tests on cast samples with differently
        sized microstructures. There were no clear defect effects on the yield strength
        as the defect amount was less than 10\_pct, and microstructural effects were
        not detected either in this case. Failure characteristics during tensile loading
        were revealed directly by in-situ strain observations using high-speed cameras.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13369-015-1834-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13369-015-1834-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-015-1834-3\"}],\"title\":\"Bactericidal

        has been suggested that red focal changes (red spots) precede the melanised
        focal changes. In the present work, we examined different populations of captive
        and wild salmon for the occurrence of both types of changes, which were investigated
        for the presence of different viruses by immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR.
        The occurrence of red or melanised foci varied significantly between the populations,
        from none in wild fish control group, low prevalence of small foci in fish
        kept in in-house tanks, to high prevalence of large foci in farm-raised salmon.
        Large amounts of Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) antigen were detected in all

        higher levels of PRV RNA than apparently non-affected areas in white muscle

        to proceed to a definitive randomised trial of IUT compared to clinical assessment
        with non-invasive tests, prior to surgery in women with stress urinary incontinence
        (SUI) or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI).MethodsA mixed
        methods study comprising a pragmatic multicentre randomised pilot trial, a
        qualitative face-to face interview study with patients eligible for the trial,
        an exploratory economic evaluation including value of information study, a
        survey of clinicians\u2019 views about IUT, and qualitative telephone interviews
        with purposively sampled survey respondents. Only the first and second of
        these elements are reported here. Trial participants were randomised to either
        clinical assessment with non-invasive tests (control arm) or clinical assessment
        with non-invasive tests plus IUT (intervention arm). The main outcome measures
        of these feasibility studies were confirmation that units can identify and
        recruit eligible women, acceptability of investigation strategies and data
        collection tools, and acquisition of outcome data to determine the sample
        size for a definitive trial. The primary outcome proposed for a definitive
        trial was ICIQ-FLUTS (total score) 6 months after surgery or the start of
        nonsurgical treatment.ResultsOf 284 eligible women, 222 (78 %) were recruited,
        165/219 (75 %) returned questionnaires at baseline, and 125/200 returned them
        (63 %) at follow-up. Most women underwent surgery; management plans were changed
        in 19 (19 %) participants following IUT. Participants interviewed were positive
        about the trial and the associated documentation.ConclusionsAll elements of
        a definitive trial were rehearsed. Such a trial would require between 232
        and 922 participants, depending on the target difference in the primary outcome.
        We identified possible modifications to our protocol for application in a
        definitive trial including clarity over inclusion/exclusions, screening processes,
        reduction in secondary outcomes, and modification to patient questionnaire
        booklets and bladder diaries. A definitive trial of IUT versus clinical assessment

        many countries are promoting energy efficiency (EE) measures as part of their
        energy strategy. Among the goals sought with these actions are producing a
        decoupling between economic growth and energy consumption, reducing the dependence
        on fossil fuels as a primary energy source, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
        Measuring direct, indirect, and co-benefit effects of EE programs is crucial.
        However, in the current literature and practice, assessments of EE programs
        have focused on direct impacts (i.e., impacts whose energy savings can be
        directly and instantaneously quantified) due to their objectivity and simplicity
        to put evaluations in a cost-effectiveness framework. Moreover, several assessment
        methodologies studying the indirect effects of EE programs only focus on identifying
        the effects and quantifying a proxy of the effects in terms of the number
        of activities developed or the number of people attending EE training or dissemination
        events. Some few existing methodologies correctly assess the indirect effects
        of EE measures, but they often require a significant budget. We propose a
        new methodology to assess the impacts of EE programs, especially focusing
        on indirect effects (i.e., long-term effects on energy use), that is suitable
        for low-budget programs. We focus on those indirect effects having the capability
        of mobilizing long-term energy savings through transformations in energy markets.
        We attempt to measure the potential future energy savings that are sustainable
        in the long term due to a behavioral transformation of energy markets. In
        order to measure these indirect effects, we use three axes: presence, valuation,
        and mobilizing capacity. This methodology was applied to 12 EE programs (implemented
        during 2011 and 2012 in Chile) in order to obtain their indirect impact assessment.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s40520-015-0444-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40520-015-0444-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40520-015-0444-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40520-015-0444-y\"}],\"title\":\"Catheter

        resultsA total of 101 consecutive patients (mean age 50.7\_\xB1\_16.9, 53\_%
        women) presenting to our center for ablation of PVC were included and assigned
        to two age groups (\\u003c65 and \u226565\_years). Clinical characteristics,
        procedural parameters, complications and success after 6-month follow up were
        compared between the two groups. Patients \u226565\_years ( n \_=\_27) showed
        a higher rate of hypertension (78 vs. 27\_%, p \_\\u003c\_0.001), coronary
        artery disease (19 vs. 12\_%, p \_=\_0.01), renal insufficiency (22 vs. 1\_%,

        feasible in elderly patients without overt heart disease. Success rates are
        not significantly different compared to patients \\u003c65\_years. Procedural
        complications are rare in both the groups. Ablation of this arrhythmia can
        therefore be regarded as a promising curative treatment in advanced age.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00436-015-4679-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00436-015-4679-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00436-015-4679-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4679-5\"}],\"title\":\"\\n

        (EEG) synchronization is becoming an essential tool to describe neurophysiological
        mechanisms of communication between brain regions under general anesthesia.
        Different synchronization measures have their own properties to reflect the
        changes of EEG activities during different anesthetic states. However, the
        performance characteristics and the relations of different synchronization
        measures in evaluating synchronization changes during propofol-induced anesthesia
        are not fully elucidated. Two-channel EEG data from seven volunteers who had
        undergone a brief standardized propofol anesthesia were then adopted to calculate
        eight synchronization indexes. We computed the prediction probability ( P
        _ K ) of synchronization indexes with Bispectral Index (BIS) and propofol
        effect-site concentration ( C _ eff ) to quantify the ability of the indexes
        to predict BIS and C _ eff . Also, box plots and coefficient of variation
        were used to reflect the different synchronization changes and their robustness
        to noise in awake, unconscious and recovery states, and the Pearson correlation
        coefficient ( R ) was used for assessing the relationship among synchronization
        measures, BIS and C _ eff . Permutation cross mutual information (PCMI) and
        determinism (DET) could predict BIS and follow C _ eff better than nonlinear
        interdependence (NI), mutual information based on kernel estimation (KerMI)
        and cross correlation. Wavelet transform coherence (WTC) in \u03B1 and \u03B2
        frequency bands followed BIS and C _ eff better than that in other frequency
        bands. There was a significant decrease in unconscious state and a significant
        increase in recovery state for PCMI and NI, while the trends were opposite
        for KerMI, DET and WTC. Phase synchronization based on phase locking value
        (PS_PLV) in \u03B4, \u03B8, \u03B1 and \u03B31 frequency bands dropped significantly
        in unconscious state, whereas it had no significant synchronization in recovery
        state. Moreover, PCMI, NI, DET correlated closely with each other and they
        had a better robustness to noise and higher correlation with BIS and C _ eff
        than other synchronization indexes. Propofol caused EEG synchronization changes
        during the anesthetic period. Different synchronization measures had individual
        properties in evaluating synchronization changes in different anesthetic states,
        which might be related to various forms of neural activities and neurophysiological

        laryngeal obstructions (E-ILOs) are important differential diagnoses to exercise-induced
        asthma and are diagnosed by the continuous laryngoscopy exercise (CLE) test.
        There are two different methods for evaluating the severity of E-ILOs using
        recordings from the CLE test; the CLE score and EILOMEA. The aim of this study
        was to investigate the consistency between these methods. Using their respective
        method, the developers of each method evaluated 60 laryngoscopic recordings
        from patients with different subtypes and various levels of severity of E-ILOs.
        The CLE score evaluates glottic and supraglottic obstructions on a 4-grade
        scale. EILOMEA uses software to calculate the obstruction severity on continuous
        scales from a still frame of the larynx during maximal obstruction giving
        three parameters reflecting glottic and supraglottic obstruction. The means
        of the EILOMEA measures differed significantly for CLE score 1 vs. 2 and 2
        vs. 3, but not for 0 vs. 1 for glottic as well as supraglottic obstructions.
        The EILOMEA method does not distinguish between CLE score 0 and 1, but otherwise
        the methods correlate. Since previous studies have suggested that only CLE
        scores of 2 and 3 reflect a severity of E-ILOs of clinical importance, this
        lack of the EILOMEA method is not crucial for a correct medical evaluation.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10853-015-9396-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10853-015-9396-z\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10853-015-9396-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-9396-z\"}],\"title\":\"Synthesis

        of daily protein intake in the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
        requires precision. Inaccuracies in recording dietary intake occur, and estimation
        from total urea excretion presents hurdles owing to the difficulty of collecting
        whole urine for 24\_h. Spot urine has been used for measuring daily sodium
        intake and urinary protein excretion.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study,
        we investigated whether urea nitrogen (UN) concentration in spot urine can
        be used to predict daily protein intake instead of the 24-h urine collection
        in 193 Japanese CKD patients (Stages G1\u2013G5). After patient randomization
        into 2 datasets for the development and validation of models, bootstrapping
        was used to develop protein intake estimation models.ResultsThe parameters
        for the candidate multivariate regression models were male gender, age, body
        mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, estimated
        glomerular filtration rate, serum albumin level, spot urinary UN and creatinine
        level, and spot urinary UN/creatinine levels. The final model contained BMI
        and spot urinary UN level. The final model was selected because of the higher
        correlation between the predicted and measured protein intakes r \_=\_0.558
        (95\_% confidence interval 0.400, 0.683), and the smaller distribution of

        abnormalities are associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) initiation
        and progression. Epigenetic drugs are being studied and in clinical trials.
        However, the molecular mechanism underlying the apoptosis by the epigenetic
        agents remains unclear. SUV39H1 is an important methyl-transferase for lysine
        9 on histone H3 and usually related to gene transcriptional suppression, and
        chaetocin acts as the inhibitor of SUV39H1. We demonstrated here that chaetocin
        effectively suppressed the growth of multiple lung cancer cells through inducing
        apoptosis in a death receptor 5 (DR5)-dependent manner. Chaetocin treatment
        activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress which gave rise to the up-regulation
        of ATF3 and CHOP. Furthermore, ATF3 and CHOP contributed to the induction
        of DR5 and subsequent apoptosis. When SUV39H1 was silenced with siRNA, the
        expression of ATF3, CHOP and DR5 was elevated. Thereafter, knockdown of SUV39H1
        induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells. In summary, chaetocin pharmacologically
        inhibits the activity of SUV39H1 which provokes ER stress and results in up-regulation
        of ATF3 and CHOP, leading to DR5-dependent apoptosis eventually. These findings
        provide a novel interpretation on the anti-neoplastic activity of epigenetic

        mortar-coated potsherds found along the East African coast. Recent sites investigated
        are in areas of Kaole, Kiswere, Rushungi, Sudi, and Mikindani in Tanzania.
        Desktop research revealed similar potsherds from Manda in the Lamu Archipelago
        of Kenya and Kilwa Kisiwani in Tanzania. From the late first millennium AD,
        asphalt has been recorded on pottery at Manda to make it waterproof. From
        around the same period, mortar was found on pottery at Kaole and on other
        artefacts in the midden deposit such as \u2018bead\u2019 grinders and bone
        deposits. This suggests natural cementation from lime introduced to the midden
        deposit. A thin layer of plaster on pots dating to the late twelfth to late
        thirteenth centuries at Kilwa Kisiwani, and eleventh to fourteenth centuries
        at Sudi, has been interpreted as deliberate to make the vessel more watertight.
        Later evidence indicates that the tradition of coating pots with lime mortar
        probably for the purposes of storing liquids continued up to the seventeenth
        and eighteenth centuries at Mikindani. However, vessels and deposits dating
        from the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries at Kiswere and Bwembweni, near
        Kaole, contain layers of mortar too thick for the purpose of waterproofing
        the vessel, and were probably used for mixing and then coating a building.
        The coastal and estuarine settings of the find spots indicate the importance
        of water transport for this lime mortar industry. The storage and transport
        of lime along the coast and inland would have been a significant part of local
        East African trade for its use in iron making and building.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3135-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3135-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3135-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11661-015-3135-6\"}],\"title\":\"Cyclic-Tension

        acoustic probe configurations were used to assess cyclic-tension fatigue in
        SS400 steel at room temperature via a diffracted horizontally polarized shear
        wave (SH) transmission method. Linear analysis of the propagation time and
        amplitude of shear and longitudinal waves with fatigue progression revealed
        that the linear behavior was governed by residual stress, attributed to the
        acoustoelastic effect. Specifically, the propagation time of the shear waves
        increased and the wave amplitude decreased with fatigue progression. Our results
        also revealed that the propagation paths of the waves became deeper with progressive
        fatigue. Additionally, when the probe angle was optimized for diffraction,
        the estimated change in the length prior to fatigue breakage was 0.61\_pct.
        Nonlinear analysis results revealed that second harmonic \u03B2 -parameters
        increased as fatigue progressed, up to ~800\_pct for the optimal frequency
        configuration; this was attributed to an increase in the number of dislocation-associated

        theories propose that latent inhibition (LI) is due to a process of interference
        with the context playing a key role as recovery cue. Physiological studies
        have demonstrated that LI is a process dependent on striatal dopamine. D2
        dopamine receptors have been specifically associated with its expression,
        while D1 receptor has shown a limited function. However, to evaluate the role
        of dopamine receptors in LI, it is necessary to analyse their activity during
        recovery phase, where the mechanisms involved in interference processes are
        performed.ObjectiveThe experiments studied the involvement of the dopaminergic
        system in the retrieval process of LI. We analysed the effect of the systemic
        administration of dopaminergic D1 (SCH-23390) and D2 (sulpiride) antagonist
        during the test phase on LI and on its contextual specificity.MethodsAnimals
        were pre-exposed to saccharin solution and conditioned with a LiCl administration
        in conditioning phase. Dopaminergic antagonist drugs were administered during
        the test phase. Experiment 2 used the same context in all the phases. Experiment
        3 used a new context during conditioning and test phase.ResultsThe D2 antagonist
        increased the LI effect and, in turn, diminished the normally suppressant
        effect of the context shift on LI. The opposite effect was observed under
        the D1 antagonist administration. This drug disrupted LI and enhanced the
        effect that the context shift had on this cognitive process.ConclusionsD2
        receptor had a relevant role on retrieval processes of pre-exposure learning,
        while D1 receptor was related with the contextual control of conditioning.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10854-015-3726-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10854-015-3726-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10854-015-3726-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10854-015-3726-4\"}],\"title\":\"New

        is a transparent polar dielectric with the highest band gap among known insulators.
        The introduction of a LiF/graphene stacked structure provides two significant
        advantages: mobility enhancement and the stability of the Fermi-level-modulated
        (doped) state without transmittance loss. The former arises from the increased
        screening of charged impurities by the high-dielectric environment of LiF,
        and the latter is due to the self-passivation effect on electron doping achieved
        by surface dipole interaction originating from high polarizability of LiF.
        Unlike unstable doping methods based on molecular adsorption or chemical bonding,
        the doping induced by a highly polar dielectric interface maintains stability
        and can be reliable method, which is compatible with the Si process.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12020-015-0732-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12020-015-0732-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12020-015-0732-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12020-015-0732-5\"}],\"title\":\"Adrenal

        synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol is used to prevent miscarriages and
        as a therapeutic treatment for prostate cancer, but it has been reported to
        have adverse effects on endocrine homeostasis. However, the toxicity mechanism
        is poorly understood. Recently, we reported that diethylstilbestrol impairs
        adrenal steroidogenesis via cholesterol insufficiency in adult male rats.
        In the present study, we found that the adrenal cholesterol level was significantly
        reduced without of the decrease in other precursors in the adrenal steroidogenesis
        24\_h after a single dose of diethylstilbestrol (0.33\_\u03BCg/g body mass).
        The serum HDL/cholesterol level was also reduced only 12\_h after the diethylstilbestrol
        exposure. The level of Apo E, which is indispensable for HDL/cholesterol maturation,
        was decreased in both the HDL and VLDL/LDL fractions, whereas the level of
        Apo A1, which is an essential constituent of HDL, was not altered in the HDL
        fraction. Because the liver is a major source of Apo E and Apo A1, the secretion
        rates of these proteins were examined using a liver perfusion experiment.
        The secretion rate of Apo A1 from the liver was consistent between DES-treated
        and control rats, but that of Apo E was comparatively suppressed in the DES-treated
        rats. The disruption of adrenal steroidogenesis by diethylstilbestrol was
        caused by a decrease in serum HDL/cholesterol, which is the main source of
        adrenal steroidogenesis, due to the inhibition of Apo E secretion from the
        liver.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/8623_2015_137\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/8623_2015_137\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/8623_2015_137\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/8623_2015_137\"}],\"title\":\"Fluorescence

        protocols for the use of UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy
        and for data acquisition and processing. UV absorbance at different wavelengths
        is used to derive optical properties, such as absorption coefficient at 254\_nm
        (a_254), specific UV absorbance (SUVA_254), and spectral slopes at different
        wavelength intervals (e.g., S_275\u2013295) or slope ratio, and data of fluorescence
        EEMs are used to identify major fluorescence components. In addition, SUVA_254
        and spectral slope values are related to aromaticity and molecular weights
        of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Oil-related fluorescent components and
        specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds could be readily
        identified using fluorescence EEMs, especially when combined with PARAFAC
        analysis. During and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of
        Mexico, three oil components were found in the water column with maximum Ex/Em
        at 224\u2013226/328\u2013340, 232\u2013244/346\u2013366, and 264\u2013252/311\u2013324\_nm,

        have been investigated to assess the prospect of using this type of compound
        as an n -type thermoelectric material. A three-dimensional (3D) physical model
        was elaborated. This takes into account two of the most important interactions

        thermal conductivity, and thermoelectric figure of merit in the direction

        crystal purity. It was shown that in stoichiometric compounds the thermoelectric

        The thermoelectric properties may be significantly enhanced by simultaneous
        increases of crystal perfection and electron concentration. The latter can
        be achieved by additional doping with donors. For less pure crystals, the

        this conceptual paper, we draw on social identity theory as a means to bridge
        individuals\u2019 memberships in social groups with value creation in stakeholder
        networks defined by a socio-economic issue. To address recent calls for microfoundations
        of stakeholder theory, we introduce a reconceptualization of stakeholders
        as social groups to examine how value is defined and interpreted in intergroup
        processes embedded in an issue-based stakeholder network. We establish a theoretical
        model of value creation that links individuals\u2019 identification with stakeholder
        groups to intergroup trust, co-operation, and value creation. Specifically,
        we argue that the salience of preexisting social identities causes harmful
        tensions in stakeholder relationships that negatively impact value creation.
        We then propose that the development of a more inclusive stakeholder identity
        overcomes these negative intergroup consequences in multistakeholder settings.
        We discuss the impact on value creation of four stakeholder identity representations
        based on the salience of specific and superordinate stakeholder groups. The
        paper concludes with implications of our theoretical model for both research

        total of 57 elderly patients with unstable intertrochanteric fracture, including
        23 males and 34 females, were treated. Their ages ranged from 80 to 95\_years,

        parental care. It is thus hypothesized that juveniles rely on protective microhabitats

        Semi-terrestrial crayfish Parastacus pugnax inhabit burrows in highly seasonal

        Following marked burrows and individual crayfish we examined the life history

        that (i) burrowing activity is higher during the wet season, (ii) reproductive
        events occur during favourable seasons and (iii) juveniles only disperse after
        reaching larger sizes. There was little or no burrowing activity during the
        dry season, when soil was more compact, but burrows became wider and had more
        openings during the wet season. After hatching, juveniles cohabited with adults
        for at least 4\_months during the dry season. During this period juveniles
        grew considerably, starting independent lives during the wet season. These

        renal cell carcinoma (RCC) shows a propensity for extending into the tributaries
        of the renal veins, which poses a notable surgical challenge. In this study
        we addressed the question as to whether patients with RCC and vein involvement
        can be identified as having a significant risk of immediate death associated
        with surgery preoperatively.Materials and MethodsA total of 118 patients with
        RCC and vein involvement from February 1999 until November 2012 were evaluated.
        The association of early mortality within 60\_days after the intervention
        was tested with various covariates including: age, body mass index (BMI),
        preoperative serum C-reactive protein, preoperative serum creatinine, preoperative
        hemoglobin level, tumor diameter, suspicion of metastasis on prior computed
        tomography, documented cardiac insufficiency, extent of vein invasion, prior
        myocardial infarction, TNM stage, American Society of Anesthesiologists score,
        New York Heart Association classification and Karnofsky index. A multiple
        logistic regression model was used to test all risk factors including the
        combination of an elevated BMI with an impaired Karnofsky index with all covariates.ResultsA
        total of 17 patients died within 60\_days after the operation with most patients
        dying from cardio-embolic complications during the first two quartiles of
        the observation, while later deaths were mostly attributable to sequelae of
        surgical complications. None of the tested risk factors were significantly
        associated with early mortality in the logistic regression model. The presence
        of an elevated BMI (\u226530\_kg/m^2) in combination with a Karnofsky index
        \u226470% predicted early death in univariate ( p \_=\_0.006) and multivariate
        analysis ( p \_=\_0.023). Death rates for patients with BMI\_\\u003c30\_kg/m^2

        respectively.ConclusionThe risk of early death is dramatically elevated to
        more than one-third of cases with elevated BMI and unfavorable Karnofsky index
        in patients with RCC and vein involvement. Patients need to be counseled in
        this regard especially when planning cytoreductive treatment without curative

        Autophagy, a dynamic process that involves the recycling of the degradation

        Arabidopsis. However, the relationship between aluminum and autophagy in plant
        is unclear while it has been reported that aluminum can increase astrocyte
        autophagy levels in animals. The role of autophagy in aluminum stress response
        in Arabidopsis was therefore studied. Our results showed that aluminum can

        defective mutants were more sensitive to aluminum conditions and showed more
        serious damages than wild-type plants, including higher oxidative damages
        and more reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Then, inductions of defense-associated
        genes in autophagy defective mutants were less than that observed in the wild-type
        plants after aluminum treatment, whereas the former had higher antioxidant
        enzymes activity. Furthermore, mutants were more compromised in PSII photochemistry
        and their detached leaves had less ability to stay green under aluminum treatment.
        These results indicate that aluminum can induce autophagy and the latter is
        necessary for defense responses to aluminum toxicity in Arabidopsis thaliana
        , and it may relieve this damage by eliminating the overproduction of ROS.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11051-015-3161-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11051-015-3161-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11051-015-3161-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11051-015-3161-8\"}],\"title\":\"Non-degradable

        are two contrasting views on the way states can use naturalisation and immigrants\u2019
        rights policies to set out their broader agenda of immigrant integration.
        First, citizenship acquisition can be seen as complementary to the granting
        of social and political rights to immigrants, as a necessary step in the process
        of full integration in the political community. Whereas granting access to
        formal membership through naturalisation may instead be seen as an alternative
        to granting social and political rights, independent of citizenship status.
        In this paper, we analyse the relation between naturalisation and integration
        policies in 29 European states, looking at immigrants\u2019 rights in several
        areas of public life, such as political participation, anti-discrimination,
        education, the labour market and family reunion. We find strong empirical
        evidence in Europe that extending membership and rights are generally used
        as complementary, rather than alternative, means to immigrant integration.
        While our analysis does not invalidate the \u2018alternative\u2019 view as

        fluid (water) and a viscoelastic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solution entering
        a microfabricated capillary entrance geometry. We show that the presence of
        polymers significantly modifies the developing flow field in the capillary
        region compared with the Newtonian solvent, resulting in a significantly increased
        entrance length ( L _e). For water over a range of Reynolds numbers 1.9\_\u2264\_Re\_\u2264\_37.5,
        we find fully developed parabolic velocity profiles are achieved within an
        entrance length given by L _e/ D _h\_=\_0.24\_+\_0.03Re, where D _h is the

        to flattened and finally concave with Wi increasing in the range 10.8\_\u2264\_Wi\_\u2264\_256.2.

        integral part of today\u2019s dermatology. A plethora of novel agents and
        techniques is currently being launched on the market accompanied by a variety
        of side effects.MethodWe summarize the most common adverse events of fillers,
        laser treatments, and injection of botulinum toxin and present feasible means
        of prevention and management.ResultsThe profile of adverse events is more
        favorable in temporary fillers such as hyaluronic acid than in permanent ones.
        The most common filler-related adverse events include changes of skin color
        and unspecific swelling. Neural and vascular dysfunctions are observed less
        frequently, but may result in severe tissue necrosis or loss of vision. Undesirable
        events of laser treatments largely depend on the applied modality, localization,
        and indication. Local effects comprise erythema, swelling, crusting, blister
        formation, and weeping in extreme cases. The formation of laser-induced scarring
        is more likely to occur in lasers with high energies. Most adverse events
        of botulinum toxin are mild and transient. Pain and redness around the sites
        of injection are common. However, a poor injection technique and injection
        of too many units can trigger major motoric impairment with ptosis and dysarthria.ConclusionExcellent
        results can be achieved with esthetic interventions. To guarantee a maximum
        amount of safety and to minimize risks it is of paramount importance to work
        with clear indications and respect contraindications. It is important to recognize
        early adverse events to achieve satisfactory results and avoid severe complications.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12304-015-9248-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12304-015-9248-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12304-015-9248-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12304-015-9248-x\"}],\"title\":\"Ecoacoustics:

        sounds produced by animals have been a topic of research into animal behaviour
        for a very long time. If acoustic signals are undoubtedly a vehicle for exchanging

        The consideration of environmental sounds for ecological investigations opens
        up a field of research that we define with the term ecoacoustics . In this
        paper, we draw the contours of ecoacoustics by detailing: the main theories,
        concepts and methods used in ecoacoustic research, and the numerous outcomes
        that can be expected from the ecological approach to sound. Ecoacoustics has
        several theoretical and practical challenges, but we firmly believe that this

        in multiple-choice assessment in preclinical medical education.MethodMultiple-choice
        questions with too high or too low difficulty (difficulty index \\u003c\u20090.4

        Items in Experimental Subgroup A underwent removal of item writing flaws along
        with enhancement of tested cognitive level (21 multiple-choice questions),
        while Experimental Subgroup B underwent replacement or removal of non-functioning

        C) did not undergo any intervention (23 multiple-choice questions).ResultPost-intervention,
        the average number of functioning distractors (\u2265\u20095\u2009% selection

        (PLA) complicated by inferior vena caval (IVC) thrombosis is rare but life-threatening.
        We experienced a case of PLA complicated by an IVC thrombus close to the right
        atrium after pancreatoduodenectomy. A 75-year-old man had undergone pancreatoduodenectomy
        with modified-Child reconstruction for pancreatic cancer 3\_years prior, and
        no recurrence was noted on follow-up. He was admitted to our hospital owing
        to fever and general fatigue. PLA and septic shock were diagnosed, and conservative
        therapy with antibiotics was initiated. His general condition gradually improved,
        but a thrombus in the middle hepatic vein and IVC was noted on follow-up computed
        tomography on hospital day 8. Although anticoagulant therapy using heparin
        was started, the thrombus size increase and extended to the right atrium.
        Considering the risk of pulmonary embolism, we planned a surgical intervention
        with a cardiovascular surgeon to remove the thrombus. During surgery, we made
        an incision in the right atrium and removed the thrombus using extracorporeal
        circulation. After removal, we dissected the middle hepatic vein using an
        automated suturing device to prevent the thrombus from extending into the
        IVC. The patient was discharged 10\_weeks after surgery. Eighteen months post-intervention,
        there was no recurrence of either PLA or thrombi. Our experience suggests

        high rates of physical and sexual victimization of women by intimate partners
        on college campuses (Black et al. 2001). College women in abusive relationships
        must weigh complex factors (health, academics, economics, and social stigma)
        during critical decision-making regarding the relationship. Rather than access
        formal support systems (e.g., campus security, administrators, counselors),
        research indicates abused college women most often turn to informal networks;
        specifically friends (Perspect Psychiatr Care 41:162\u2013171, 2005), who
        often lack the knowledge or resources to provide effective support (Nurs Res
        54(4):235\u2013242, 2005). Decision aids have been shown to assist with health-related
        decisions by improving knowledge, creating realistic expectations, and resolving
        decisional conflict (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 1:1\u2013332, 2014).Methods/DesignThis
        study is a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of an interactive
        safety decision aid web-based and smartphone application (App) for abused
        college women and their friends. Three hundred female college students experiencing
        abuse and three hundred friends of female college students experiencing abuse
        will be recruited in Maryland and Oregon and randomized to either the intervention
        safety decision aid, accessible by website or smartphone App, or a usual safety
        planning control website/App. The intervention App allows users to enter information
        on: a) relationship health; b) safety priorities; and c) severity of violence/danger
        in relationship. The App uses this information to provide personalized safety
        planning information and resources. Self-reported outcome measures for abused
        college women on safety seeking behaviors, decisional conflict, IPV exposure
        and mental health will be collected at baseline, six, and 12-months post-baseline
        via the study App/website. Outcomes measured for friends are IPV awareness,
        confidence to intervene, supportive behaviors and decisional conflict. Protocols
        for safely recruiting, retaining and collecting data from abused women via

        This study is the first, to our knowledge, to test an intervention that engages

        disoproxil fumarate (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF) and pravastatin/fenofibrate.Case presentationA
        68-year old Caucasian man presented with progressive pain in both legs two
        weeks after commencing treatment with EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF. He was found to have
        biochemical evidence of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.ConclusionWe
        emphasize the need for post marketing surveillance of adverse effects of new
        products. Pharmacokinetic studies are necessary to investigate the levels
        of pravastatin in patients taking COBI and fenofibrate with and without other
        comorbidities. Meanwhile, we suggest that creatine kinase levels should be
        monitored and patients advised to report myalgias when using concomitant EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF
        and pravastatin/fenofibrate. This case serves as an important reminder to
        use estimated glomerular filtration rates rather than serum creatinine levels
        when choosing new medications. If potentially nephrotoxic combinations are
        started in patients with borderline estimated glomerular filtration rates,
        it may be prudent to check these filtration rates more frequently than usual.
        In patients with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rates, potentially
        nephrotoxic combinations should be avoided wherever possible.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10570-015-0713-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10570-015-0713-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10570-015-0713-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-015-0713-0\"}],\"title\":\"Cotton

        copolymerisation of 2-methacryloyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC).
        These modified cotton fabrics were first applied to reactive dyeing without
        the addition of inorganic salt. Grafting was confirmed by obtaining Fourier

        DMC-to-cotton mass ratio, reaction time and acid concentration, were optimised
        to enhance the grafting amount of DMC and obtain high dye exhaustion. The
        surface morphological characteristics and strength properties of the modified

        realized in Group 14 elemental honeycomb lattices, but all are inversionsymmetric.
        Here, based on first-principles calculations, we predict a new family of 2D
        inversion-asymmetric TIs with sizeable bulk gaps from 105 meV to 284 meV,
        in X2\u2013GeSn (X = H, F, Cl, Br, I) monolayers, making them in principle
        suitable for room-temperature applications. The nontrivial topological characteristics
        of inverted band orders are identified in pristine X2\u2013GeSn with X = (F,
        Cl, Br, I), whereas H2\u2013GeSn undergoes a nontrivial band inversion at
        8% lattice expansion. Topologically protected edge states are identified in
        X2\u2013GeSn with X = (F, Cl, Br, I), as well as in strained H2\u2013GeSn.
        More importantly, the edges of these systems, which exhibit single-Dirac-cone
        characteristics located exactly in the middle of their bulk band gaps, are
        ideal for dissipationless transport. Thus, Group 14 elemental honeycomb lattices
        provide a fascinating playground for the manipulation of quantum states.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11064-015-1714-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11064-015-1714-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11064-015-1714-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11064-015-1714-y\"}],\"title\":\"Proteinase

        3 (PR3) is released from neutrophil granules and is involved in the inflammatory
        process. PR3 is implicated in antimicrobial defense and cell death, but the
        exact role of PR3 in the brain is less defined. Microglia is the major immune
        effector cells in the CNS and is activated by brain injury. In the present
        study, the effect of PR3 on glial activation was investigated. Microglial
        activation was assessed by the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species
        and expression of inflammatory cytokines. The conditioned media from activated
        microglia by PR3 was used for measuring the neurotoxic effects of PR3-stimulated
        microglia. The effects of PR3 in vivo were measured by microinjecting PR3
        into the rat brain. Herein we show that PR3 increased the inflammatory responses
        including the intracellular ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in
        rat primary microglia. Conditioned media from PR3-treated microglia induced
        neuronal cell death in a concentration dependent manner. Furthermore, microinjected
        PR3 into the striatum of the rat brain induced microglial activation and neuronal
        cell death. Interestingly treatment with anti-PR3 monoclonal antibody and
        protease inhibitors ameliorated microglial activation induced by PR3 in primary
        microglia and striatum, which also prevented neuronal cell death in both conditions.
        The data presented here suggest that PR3 is a direct modulator of microglial
        activation and causes neuronal death through the augmentation of inflammatory
        responses. We suggest that PR3 could be a new modulator of neuroinflammation,
        and blocking PR3 would be a promising novel therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory
        disease such as stroke and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10526-015-9696-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10526-015-9696-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10526-015-9696-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-015-9696-x\"}],\"title\":\"Density-dependent

        cisplatin resistance. To understand the mechanism leading to the development
        of cisplatin resistance in ESCC, we compared the proteomes from a cisplatin-resistant
        HKESC-2R cell line with its parental-sensitive counterpart HKESC-2 to identify
        key molecule involved in this process. Mass spectrometry analysis detected
        14-3-3\u03C3 as the most abundant molecule expressed exclusively in HKESC-2R
        cells, while western blot result further validated it to be highly expressed
        in HKESC-2R cells when compared to HKESC-2 cells. Ectopic expression of 14-3-3\u03C3
        increased cisplatin resistance in HKESC-2 cells, while its suppression sensitized
        SLMT-1 cells to cisplatin. Among the molecules involved in drug detoxification,

        and XPA were found to be highly expressed in HKESC-2R cells with high 14-3-3\u03C3

        and knockdown approaches concurrently altered the expression of HMGB1 and
        XPA. 14-3-3\u03C3, HMGB1, and XPA were preferentially expressed in cisplatin-resistant

        joint infection (PJI) is the leading cause for early failure of total knee

        (SFC) have been shown to increase the detection rate of PJI in comparison
        to the use of conventional microbiological methods. The hypothesis of this
        study is that sonication will improve not only the detection rate of PJI,
        but also the detection rate of polymicrobial infection in patients with TKA
        revision surgery.Materials and methods109 patients, undergoing TKA revision
        surgery, were enrolled in this prospective cohort study and received a synovial
        aspiration, intraoperative tissue cultures, histological sampling of the periprosthetic
        membrane (PM), and sonication of the explanted endoprosthesis. A PJI was defined
        according to the following criteria: presence of intraarticular pus or a sinus
        tract, positive isolation of the same bacterial species in\_\u22652 microbiological
        samples or a PM indicative of infection.Results31 patients had a defined PJI
        according to the above-mentioned criteria. SFC achieved the highest sensitivity
        (74\_%) of all microbiological methods. The PM achieved a sensitivity of 87\_%.
        When the results of the SFC and the PM were combined, it was possible to further
        increase the sensitivity to 94\_%. The utilization of SFC doubled the number
        of polymicrobial bacterial isolations in our patient collective. There were
        12 cases of polymicrobial bacterial isolations, six were detectable through
        conventional microbiological methods, four were detectable through SFC and
        two were identifiable as polymicrobial through the isolation of an additional

        community organizations. An overview of literature identified three dominant
        rural health issues affecting the provision of spiritual care in rural areas,
        namely the disparity between rural and urban areas in terms of resources,
        the lack of access to services, plus the need for education and training within
        rural areas. Spiritual Health Victoria Incorporated (Victoria, Australia)

        cells (GECs) undergo apoptosis during H. pylori infection and phagocytes within
        the mucosa engulf these cells. The recognition and clearance of apoptotic
        cells is a multifactorial process, enhanced by the presence of various bridging
        molecules and opsonins which are abundant in serum. However, it is not clear
        how recognition or clearance may differ in the context of H. pylori infection
        induced apoptosis. In addition, efferocytosis of sterile apoptotic cells is
        known to confer anti-inflammatory properties in the engulfing phagocyte, however
        it is unknown if this is maintained when phagocytes encounter H. pylori- infected
        cells. Thus, the ability of macrophages to bind and engulf gastric epithelial
        cells rendered apoptotic by H. pylori infection and the association of these
        interactions to the modulation of phagocyte inflammatory responses was investigated
        in the absence and presence of serum with a particular focus on the role of
        serum protein C1q.MethodsControl (uninfected) or H. pylori -infected AGS cells

        Binding of AGS cells to THP-1 macrophages was assessed by microscopy and cytokine
        (IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1) release from LPS stimulated THP-1 macrophages was quantified
        by ELISA.ResultsWe show that macrophages bound preferentially to cells undergoing
        apoptosis subsequent to infection with H. pylori . Binding of apoptotic AGS
        to THP-1 macrophages was significantly inhibited when studied in the absence
        of serum and reconstitution of serum-free medium with purified human C1q restored
        binding of macrophages to apoptotic cells. Co-culture of sterile apoptotic
        and H. pylori- infected AGS cells both attenuated LPS-stimulated cytokine
        production by THP-1 macrophages. Further, direct treatment of THP-1 macrophages
        with C1q attenuated LPS stimulated TNF-\u03B1 production.ConclusionsThese

        No differences existed in the ability of infected or sterile apoptotic cells

        we performed a homology modeling study of ABHD6 based on the assumption that
        the catalytic triad of ABHD6 comprises Ser148\u2013His306\u2013Asp 278 and
        the oxyanion hole is formed by Met149 and Phe80. A total of 42 compounds was
        docked to the homology model using the Glide module from the Schr\xF6dinger
        suite of software and the selected docking poses were used for CoMFA alignment.
        A model with the following statistics was obtained: R ^2\_=\_0.98, Q ^2\_=\_0.55.
        In order to study the molecular interactions of the inhibitors with ABHD6
        in detail, molecular dynamics was performed with the Desmond program. It was
        found that, during the simulations, the hydrogen bond between the inhibitor
        carbonyl group and the main chain of Phe80 is weakened, whereas a new hydrogen
        bond with the side chain of Ser148 is formed, facilitating the possible formation

        translocation has become a widely used tool to improve the conservation status
        of threatened plants. Dianthus morisianus (Caryophyllaceae) is a narrow endemic
        plant which only grows on the Portixeddu coastal dune (South-West Sardinia).
        Its natural habitat has been strongly modified, and it is currently considered
        one of the most threatened plants of Sardinia. In a conservation effort, a
        translocation of reproductive plants was planned. Plants were obtained from
        seeds collected in the natural population and cultivated at the Botanic Gardens
        of Cagliari University. The following two suitable areas near the natural
        population were identified: the first is located in a fenced site which is
        managed by public administration, and the second is located in an unprotected
        site. In November 2010, 113 plants were reintroduced in site one, and in February
        2011, 25 plants were reintroduced in site two; all plants were regularly monitored.
        The aim was to analyse the effect of different management activities (i.e.
        the herbivore and human exclusion) on transplanted plants. The following consistent
        differences between sites with different management types were found: the
        survival and growth of D. morisianus were enhanced by reducing herbivory and
        human disturbance; in particular, fences positively enhanced the plant\u2019s
        long-term survival, reproductive success and seedling recruitment. This study
        highlights that management activities (i.e. erection of fences) should be
        incorporated into translocation design since they contribute to translocation
        success. Our experience can serve as a model for further translocations of
        the threatened plants of Sardinia and, more widely, of the Mediterranean islands.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11704-015-4528-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11704-015-4528-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-015-4528-9\"}],\"title\":\"Protecting

        preservation has recently received considerable attention for location-based
        mobile services. A lot of location cloaking approaches focus on identity and
        location protection, but few algorithms pay attention to prevent sensitive
        information disclosure using query semantics. In terms of personalized privacy
        requirements, all queries in a cloaking set, from some user\u2019s point of
        view, are sensitive. These users regard the privacy is breached. This attack
        is called as the sensitivity homogeneity attack. We show that none of the
        existing location cloaking approaches can effectively resolve this problem
        over road networks. We propose a ( K, L, P )-anonymity model and a personalized
        privacy protection cloaking algorithm over road networks, aiming at protecting
        the identity, location and sensitive information for each user. The main idea
        of our method is first to partition users into different groups as anonymity
        requirements. Then, unsafe groups are adjusted by inserting relaxed conservative
        users considering sensitivity requirements. Finally, segments covered by each
        group are published to protect location information. The efficiency and effectiveness
        of the method are validated by a series of carefully designed experiments.
        The experimental results also show that the price paid for defending against
        sensitivity homogeneity attacks is small.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00410-015-1185-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00410-015-1185-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00410-015-1185-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00410-015-1185-9\"}],\"title\":\"Transition

        investigate the water budget in deep accretionary prisms, we undertook a detailed
        petrologic analysis of garnet-bearing amphibolites in the subduction-origin
        high-pressure Sanbagawa metamorphic belt, Japan. We obtained a continuous
        P \u2013 T path of exhumation by the application of differential thermodynamics
        to compositional zoning in both garnet and amphibole. The P \u2013 T path
        is characterized by three stages of decompression: (1) heating decompression
        from 1.5 GPa and 550\_\xB0C to 1.1 GPa and 600\_\xB0C; (2) isothermal decompression
        toward 0.8 GPa and 580\_\xB0C; and (3) cooling decompression to 0.3 GPa and
        400\_\xB0C. Comparison with the results of numerical modeling of the thermal
        structures of subduction zones suggests that the peak-pressure condition is
        warmer than the slab surface temperature in a typical subduction zone, but
        is consistent with subduction of a young slab during the Sanbagawa metamorphism.
        The heating decompression just after the peak-pressure condition is explained
        by heating from the mantle wedge during ascent of the metamorphic body in
        the accretionary prism; heating stops when the metamorphic body reaches crustal
        depths. Mass balance calculations for the mineral reactions in an amphibolite
        reveal that the dehydration associated with the growth of Ca-poor garnet takes
        place during heating decompression, whereas hydration takes place during cooling
        decompression by the breakdown of garnet and pargasite to form chlorite and
        actinolite. Such a transition from dehydration to hydration in the exhuming
        metabasite body in an accretionary prism generates fluids between the continental
        Moho and the slab surface and may explain the seismic activity above the subduction
        plate boundary, such as supra-slab earthquakes.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10973-015-5012-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10973-015-5012-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10973-015-5012-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10973-015-5012-3\"}],\"title\":\"Studies

        of oil shale from different regions with spent oil shale from subcritical

        10 and 30\_\xB0C\_min^\u22121, nitrogen flow rate of 30\_mL\_min^\u22121.
        Three different stages are identified based on TG curves of the mixture samples.
        The second stage which is due to the release of volatile matter is the primary
        reaction stage, and the mass loss discrepancies of the experimental and calculated
        TG profiles in the second stage are considered as a measurement of the interactions
        extent during the co-pyrolysis. The experimental mass loss of Nong\u2019an
        and Fushun oil shale/spent oil shale mixture samples is higher than the calculated
        data, and the experimental mass loss of Huadian and Mudanjiang oil shale/spent

        is the most specific beta cell antigen and a potential primary autoantigen
        in type 1 diabetes. Insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) are the earliest marker
        of beta cell autoimmunity; however, only slightly more than 50% of children
        and even fewer adults newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes are IAA positive.
        The aim of this investigation was to determine if oxidative post-translational
        modification (oxPTM) of insulin by reactive oxidants associated with islet
        inflammation generates neoepitopes that stimulate an immune response in individuals
        with type 1 diabetes.MethodsoxPTM of insulin was generated using ribose and
        various reactive oxygen species. Modifications were analysed by SDS-PAGE,
        three-dimensional fluorescence and MS. Autoreactivity to oxPTM insulin (oxPTM-INS)
        was observed by ELISA and western blotting, using sera from participants with
        type 1 or type 2 diabetes and healthy controls as probes. IAA was measured
        using the gold-standard radiobinding assay (RBA).ResultsMS of oxPTM-INS identified
        chlorination of Tyr16 and Tyr26; oxidation of His5, Cys7 and Phe24; and glycation
        of Lys29 and Phe1 in chain B. Significantly higher binding to oxPTM-INS vs

        sensitivity compared with 61% sensitivity for RBA. oxPTM-INS autoantibodies
        and IAA co-existed in 50% of those with type 1 diabetes. Importantly 34% of
        those with diabetes who were IAA negative were oxPTM-INS positive. Altogether,
        95% of participants with type 1 diabetes presented with autoimmunity to insulin
        by RBA, oxPTM-INS or both. Binding to oxPTM-INS was directed towards oxPTM-INS

        and 270 mAh\xB7g^\u20131 at 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 mA\xB7g^\u20131, respectively).
        Such a high-rate performance for the Sb-C anode has rarely been reported.
        The remarkable electrochemical behavior of 10-Sb@C is attributed to the synergetic
        effects of ultra-small Sb nanoparticles with an uniform distribution and a
        porous C framework, which can effectively alleviate the stress associated
        with a large volume change and suppress the agglomeration of the pulverized
        nanoparticles during prolonged charge-discharge cycling.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10526-015-9697-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10526-015-9697-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10526-015-9697-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-015-9697-9\"}],\"title\":\"Movement

        Prior to the development of models, gamma test was used to identify the best

        Wavelet-ANN and Wavelet-ANFIS performed reasonably better than other models.
        Better handling of wavelet-decomposed input variables enabled Wavelet-ANN

        ROM, improved significantly at 9-year follow-up, and the outcome was considered
        good or excellent in 92.6\_% of the patients. Radiographic results showed
        that both tibial plateau angle and posterior tibial slope angles were maintained,
        whereas femoro-tibial angle was significantly changed at follow-up. Further
        analysis showed no significant correlation between clinical scores and body

        human SCNT was matched by equally ardent warnings of its ethical perils. This
        commentary compares the predicted promises and perils of human SCNT to the
        current scientific and ethical realities, taking note of underappreciated
        issues that have emerged in the interim.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4428-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4428-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4428-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10967-015-4428-3\"}],\"title\":\"Laser

        region is covering the northern most part of Pakistan where the rocks of the
        Kohistan-Ladakh island arc and Karakoram plate are exposed. The area has greater
        potential for precious and base metals deposits which are needed to be explored
        through spectroscopy and remote sensing techniques. Minerals and rocks can
        nowadays be identified through the measurement of their absorption and reflectance
        features by spectroscopic analysis. Spectral reflectance analysis is also
        very important in selecting the appropriate spectral bands for remote-sensing
        data analysis of unknown or inaccessible areas. In this study, reflectance
        spectra in the spectral range of 0.35\u20132.5\_\u03BCm of different types
        of unaltered and altered rocks found in the Machulu and Astor areas of northern
        Pakistan were obtained using an ASD spectroradiometer. The fresh rock samples
        showed low spectral reflectance as compared to the altered rock samples. The
        minerals jarosite, goethite, and hematite showed depth of absorption minima
        in the range of 0.4\u20131.15\_\u03BCm due to the presence of iron (Fe), while
        jarosite and limonite showed absorption depth at 2.2\_\u03BCm due to the presence
        of hydroxyl ions (OH^\xAF). The clay minerals montmorillonite and illite showed
        absorption depth at 1.93 and 2.1\_\u03BCm, respectively. Muscovite showed
        depth of absorption minima at 1.4 and 1.9\_\u03BCm in some samples. Calcite
        showed deep absorption minima at 2.32\_\u03BCm, while anorthite showed absorption
        features at 1.4, 1.9, 2.24, and 2.33\_\u03BCm. Olivine showed a slight depressed
        absorption feature at 1.07\_\u03BCm. The copper-bearing phases malachite,
        chrysocolla, and azurite showed, respectively, a broad absorption feature
        in the range of 0.6\u20130.9\_\u03BCm, a small absorption at 1.4\_\u03BCm,
        and a deep absorption at 1.93\_\u03BCm. The unmineralized samples exhibited
        high reflectance in the wavelength ranges of 0.6\u20130.8, 1.6\u20131.9, 2.0\u20132.3,
        2.1\u20132.25, and 2.4\u20132.5\_\u03BCm, respectively, while the mineralized

        showing a tendency of increasing with age ( P \_=\_0.000). A total of 3470
        serum samples from farmed pigs were collected and tested for antibodies to
        EMCV. A high seroprevalence of 77\_% was recorded, and significant regional
        differences were observed. It was concluded that people and pigs in China
        were commonly infected by EMCV. In addition, in order to characterize changes
        of seroprevalence during natural EMCV infection in pigs, 240 serial serum
        samples were collected from 30 pigs (at 0, 15, 30, 60, 75, 90, 120, and 150
        days of age) in a farrow-to-finish farm in China. The data showed that there
        were two EMCV antibody peaks: the first peak appeared at day 30, followed
        by a decrease in EMCV antibody titer, and the second occurred after day 75.
        Thus, the most susceptible period of pigs for EMCV infection was between day
        30 and day 75 of age.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11557-015-1094-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11557-015-1094-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11557-015-1094-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-015-1094-3\"}],\"title\":\"Taxonomic

        studies have linked domperidone use with serious cardiac arrhythmias, including
        sudden cardiac death, but data on age, dose, and duration of use are limited.ObjectivesThe
        aim of this study was to assess the risk of out-of-hospital sudden cardiac
        death associated with domperidone use versus proton pump inhibitors (PPIs),
        metoclopramide, or non-use of all three medications, and to evaluate the risk
        of sudden cardiac death in relation to age and domperidone dose.MethodsThis
        was a population-based case-control study nested in a cohort of subjects aged\_\u22652\_years
        in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with one or more prescriptions
        for domperidone, any PPI, or metoclopramide from 2005 to 2011. Out-of-hospital
        sudden cardiac death was assessed by linkage with Hospital Episode Statistics
        and death certificates. Controls were matched on age, sex, and medical practice.
        The risk of sudden cardiac death in domperidone users versus risk in users
        of PPIs or metoclopramide was evaluated with multivariable conditional logistic
        regression; case-crossover analysis addressed possible residual confounding.ResultsFrom
        the study cohort ( n \_=\_681,104), 3239 sudden cardiac death cases were matched
        to 12,572 controls. The adjusted odds ratio (95\_% confidence interval) for
        sudden cardiac death with current use of domperidone alone was 1.71 (0.92\u20133.18)
        versus non-use of study medications, 1.26 (0.68\u20132.34) versus current
        PPI use, and 0.40 (0.17\u20130.94) current metoclopramide use. The adjusted
        odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) relative to exposure to no study drug
        for domperidone \\u003e30 mg/day (eight cases, five controls) was 3.20 (0.59\u201317.3)
        and 1.65 (0.89\u20133.07) for age \u226561 years (27 cases, 49 controls).
        The odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) was 3.17 (1.72\u20135.83) for within-person
        periods of domperidone use versus non-use in the case-crossover analysis.ConclusionsCompared
        with non-use of any study drug, current domperidone use was associated with
        sudden cardiac death in nested case-control and case-crossover analyses, with
        a suggestion of higher risk in older persons and users of higher daily doses.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10750-015-2479-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10750-015-2479-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10750-015-2479-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2479-7\"}],\"title\":\"Spatial

        of Cl^\u2212 by the ruffled border of osteoclasts enables H^+ secretion by
        v-H^+-ATPases to dissolve bone mineral. Mice lacking ClC-7 show altered lysosomal
        function that leads to severe lysosomal storage. Maturation ameloblasts are
        epithelial cells with a ruffled border that secrete Cl^\u2212 as well as endocytose
        and digest large quantities of enamel matrix proteins during formation of
        dental enamel. We tested the hypothesis that ClC-7 in maturation ameloblasts
        is required for intracellular digestion of matrix fragments to complete enamel
        mineralization. Craniofacial bones and developing teeth in Clcn7 ^-/- mice
        were examined by micro-CT, immunohistochemistry, quantified histomorphometry
        and electron microscopy. Osteoclasts and ameloblasts in wild-type mice stained
        intensely with anti-ClC-7 antibody but not in Clcn7 ^-/- mice. Craniofacial
        bones in Clcn7 ^-/- mice were severely osteopetrotic and contained 1.4- to

        compacted teeth, dentin was slightly less mineralized, enamel did not retain
        a matrix and mineralized fairly normal. We concluded that ClC-7 is essential
        for osteoclasts to resorb craniofacial bones to enable tooth eruption and

        progress such as high-throughput next-generation sequencing, numerous circRNAs
        have recently been detected in many species. CircRNAs were expressed in a
        spatio-temporally specific manner, suggesting their regulatory functional

        found with critical physiological functions in certain circumstances. CircRNAs
        have a more stable molecular structure that can resist to exoribonuclease

        44%, New Zealand has the highest proportion of international medical graduates
        (IMGs) in its workforce amongst OECD member countries. Around half of New
        Zealand\u2019s IMGs come from the UK NHS, yet only around 50% stay longer
        than 1\_year post-registration with significant costs to the New Zealand health
        care system. Why these doctors go to New Zealand and do not stay for long
        is an important question.MethodsUK-trained doctors who had gained registration
        with the Medical Council of New Zealand and currently practising in New Zealand
        were surveyed ( n \u2009=\u20091357) on the motivation for their move to New
        Zealand, experiences once there and what was prompting any intentions to move
        away from New Zealand. Multivariate proportional odds models (POM) were used
        to quantify various associations.ResultsThe survey had a 47% response ( n
        \u2009=\u2009632). Quality of life considerations motivated 96% of respondents
        to move to New Zealand, although 65% indicated they were pushed by a desire
        to leave the NHS. POM analyses revealed older respondents were significantly
        less likely than younger respondents to be motivated by quality of life considerations.
        Younger doctors were significantly more likely to be seeking to leave the
        NHS. Seventy-six per cent of respondents signalling an intention to leave
        New Zealand indicated that the desire to return to the UK was the primary
        reason for this.ConclusionThere is a long history of medical migration from
        the UK to New Zealand. However, the 65% of respondents in this study seeking
        to leave the NHS was much higher than found elsewhere, perhaps reflecting
        increasing workplace and funding pressures in recent years. Of concern to
        policy makers were the higher odds of seeking to leave the NHS motivating
        younger doctors. Various changes \u201Cdown under\u201D, in New Zealand as
        well as Australia, mean their IMG markets may well be tightening up.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11082-015-0253-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11082-015-0253-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11082-015-0253-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11082-015-0253-8\"}],\"title\":\"Reduction

        product design and digital model conversion between different computer-aided
        design (CAD) systems and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems, a lot
        of broken surfaces are introduced in the digital models of aircraft skin parts,
        which have a great negative impact on numerical control (NC) programming efficiency.
        Broken surfaces fitting is an effective means to solve the above issues. The
        difficulties of broken surfaces fitting contain two aspects: (1) how to determine
        which ones of all the broken surfaces should be combined together automatically
        according to process requirements, and (2) how to obtain complete surface
        boundaries which could satisfy process requirements. In order to address the
        above difficulties, a feature-based automatic broken surfaces fitting method
        for complex aircraft skin parts is proposed in this paper. In contrast to
        traditional feature definition where broken surfaces and boundaries are restrained,
        while a novel feature definition method is introduced, where broken surfaces
        and boundaries are taken into account by considering adjacent relationship
        between surfaces. The broken surfaces which need to be fitted into one surface
        according to process requirements can be grouped automatically from all the
        broken surfaces by taking advantage of features definition and recognition.
        The broken surfaces fitting results show that the size, shape, and boundary
        of the fitted surfaces have good consistency with original surfaces, which
        could be directly used for NC programming, and it is expected to improve NC
        programming efficiency of skin parts dramatically.\"}],\"facets\":[{\"name\":\"subject\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"Medicine

        cancer is one of the most common cancers and is the second leading cause of
        cancer mortality in women worldwide. Novel therapies and chemo-therapeutic
        drugs are urgently needed to be developed for the treatment of breast cancer.
        Increasing evidence suggests that fatty acid synthase (FAS) plays an important
        role in breast cancer, for the expression of FAS is significantly higher in
        human breast cancer cells than in normal cells. Tannic acid (TA), a natural
        polyphenol, possesses significant biological functions, including bacteriostasis,
        hemostasis, and anti-oxidant. Our previous studies demonstrated that TA is
        a natural FAS inhibitor whose inhibitory activity is stronger than that of
        classical FAS inhibitors, such as C75 and cerulenin. This study further assessed
        the effect and therapeutic potential of TA on FAS over-expressed breast cancer
        cells, and as a result, TA had been proven to possess the functions of inhibiting
        intracellular FAS activity, down-regulating FAS expression in human breast
        cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, and inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Since
        high-expressed FAS is recognized as a molecular marker for breast cancer and
        plays an important role in cancer prognosis, these findings suggest that TA
        is a potential drug candidate for treatment of breast cancer.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12599-015-0404-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12599-015-0404-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12599-015-0404-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12599-015-0404-2\"}],\"title\":\"Call

        patients with a MH were examined in one time cross-sectional study. The vitreomacular
        interface was assessed using SD-OCT with conventional and EVI technique. Twenty-three
        of the 34 eyes did not show a Weiss ring, and in 22 of those, we observed
        a MH with an open roof or operculum and a detached posterior vitreous cortex
        with conventional vitreous imaging. Using EVI-OCT, we visualized the reflection
        of the posterior vitreous with a vitreopapillary attachment. One of the 23
        eyes without a Weiss ring had a central round retinal defect without an operculum,
        and the conventional SD-OCT showed an empty vitreous, suggesting a complete
        posterior vitreous detachment. However, the EVI-OCT revealed the reflection
        of the posterior vitreous, and the cortex appeared to still be completely

        ion (Ca^2+) uptake into the mitochondrial matrix influences ATP production,
        Ca^2+ homeostasis, and apoptosis regulation. Ca^2+ uptake across the ion-impermeable
        inner mitochondrial membrane is mediated by the mitochondrial Ca^2+ uniporter
        (MCU) complex. The MCU complex forms a pore structure composed of several
        proteins. MCU is a Ca^2+-selective channel in the inner-mitochondrial membrane
        that allows electrophoretic Ca^2+ entry into the matrix. Mitochondrial Ca^2+
        uptake 1 (MICU1) functions as a Ca^2+-sensing regulator of the MCU complex.
        Previously, by microscopic analysis at the single-cell level, we found that
        during mast cell activation, mitochondria capture cytosolic Ca^2+ in two steps.
        Consequently, mitochondrial Ca^2+ uptake likely plays a role in cellular function
        through cytosolic Ca^2+ buffering. Here, we investigate the role of MCU and
        MICU1 in mitochondrial Ca^2+ uptake and mast cell degranulation using MCU-
        and MICU1-knockdown (KD) mast cells. Whereas MCU- and MICU1-KD mast cells
        show normal proliferation rates and mitochondrial membrane potential, they
        exhibit slow and reduced cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca^2+ elevation after
        antigen stimulation. Moreover, \u03B2-hexosaminidase release induced by antigen
        was significantly suppressed in MCU-KD cells but not MICU1-KD cells. This
        suggests that both MCU and MICU1 are involved in mitochondrial Ca^2+ uptake
        in mast cells, while MCU plays a role in mast cell degranulation.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0937-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0937-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0937-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-015-0937-1\"}],\"title\":\"Remote

        myocardial infarction (STEMI) accounts for nearly one third of acute coronary
        syndromes. Despite improved STEMI patient care, mortality remains high, contributing
        significantly to the ischemic heart disease burden. This may partly be related
        to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC),
        through short cycles of ischemia-reperfusion applied to a limb, has been shown
        to reduce IRI in various clinical settings. Our primary hypothesis is that
        RIC will reduce adverse events related to STEMI when applied as adjunctive
        therapy to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Methods/Design\u201CRemote
        ischemic conditioning in ST-elevation myocardial infarction as adjuvant to
        primary angioplasty\u201D (RIC-STEMI) is an ongoing prospective, single-center,
        open-label, randomized controlled trial to assess whether RIC as an adjunctive
        therapy during primary PCI in patients presenting with STEMI can improve clinical
        outcomes. After enrollment, participants are randomized according to a computer-generated
        randomization schedule, in a ratio of 1:1 to RIC or no intervention, in blocks
        of four individuals. RIC is begun at least 10\_min before the estimated time
        of the first balloon inflation and its duration is 30\_min. Ischemia is induced
        by three cycles of inflation of a blood pressure cuff placed on the left lower
        limb to 200\_mmHg and then deflation to 0\_mmHg for another 5\_min. Primary
        endpoint is a combined endpoint of death from cardiac cause or hospitalization
        for heart failure (HF) on follow-up (including device implantation: implantable
        cardioverter defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization and left ventricular
        assist device). Secondary endpoints are myocardial infarction (MI) size (estimated
        by the 48\_h area under the curve of serum troponin I levels), development
        of Q-wave MI, left ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography within
        the first 3\_days after admission), contrast-induced nephropathy, in-hospital
        mortality, all-cause mortality and, finally, major adverse cardiovascular
        events. Patients will have a minimum follow-up period of 12\_months. From
        11 March 2013 to 31 December 2014, 324 patients have been enrolled and randomized.

        electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS), a non-invasive and non-pharmacological
        adjunctive intervention for perioperative analgesia, may also reduce the incidence
        of postoperative pulmonary complications. The effect of TEAS on video-assisted
        thoracic surgical (VATS) patients is still unknown, however. The purpose of
        this study was to investigate the effects of TEAS of different frequency on
        perioperative anesthetic dosage, recovery, complications, and prognosis for
        patients undergoing VATS lobectomy.MethodsEighty VATS lobectomy patients with
        no previous experience of TEAS or acupuncture were randomly assigned to four
        groups: control (con), 2/100, 2, and 100\_Hz. The last three experimental
        groups received TEAS at the indicated frequencies for 30\_min before induction,
        during the operation, and for another 30\_min 24 and 48\_h after surgery.
        2/100\_Hz is a type of alternating frequency which goes between 2 and 100\_Hz
        every 3\_s. TEAS was administered over acupoints Neiguan, Hegu, Lieque, and
        Quchi on the sick lateral. Electrodes were applied to the patients in the
        control group, but no TEAS was used. Anesthetic dosage, blood gas analysis
        results, lung function indexes FEV_1 and FVC, post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)
        status, postoperative complications, and quality of life scores were recorded
        and analyzed statistically.ResultsIntraoperative opioid consumption was lowest
        in the 2/100\_Hz group, with statistical significance (con, P \_\u2264\_0.001;
        2\_Hz, P \_\u2264\_0.001; 100\_Hz, P \_=\_0.026). Compared with preoperative
        FEV_1 and FVC, postoperative FEV_1 and FVC were significantly lower in all
        groups; during one-lung ventilation, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO_2)
        decreased more slowly in the 2/100\_Hz group than in the con group ( P \_=\_0.042).
        Moreover, in the 2/100\_Hz group extubation time was shorter ( P \_=\_0.038),
        visual analgesia scale score lower ( P \_=\_0.047), and duration of PACU stay
        shorter ( P \_=\_0.043) than in the con group. In the 100\_Hz group incidence
        of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was lower than the con group (
        P \_=\_0.044). In all groups mean postoperative physical component scores
        were significantly lower than mean preoperative scores.ConclusionsTEAS is
        a safe noninvasive adjunctive intervention for anesthesia management among
        patients undergoing VATS lobectomy. TEAS at 2/100\_Hz can reduce intraoperative
        opioid dosage and slow the decrease of PaO_2 during one-lung ventilation.
        It can also effectively reduce pain score, extubation time, and PACU stay
        immediately after surgery. Further, 100\_Hz TEAS can reduce PONV morbidity.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11606-015-3504-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11606-015-3504-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11606-015-3504-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-015-3504-2\"}],\"title\":\"Colorectal

        psychometric properties of the Dependency-oriented and Achievement-oriented

        of child pathology from an early age, it is important to evaluate the DAPCS
        in younger samples too. We examine the DAPCS\u2019 validity in two samples
        of elementary school age children ( n \_=\_180 and n \_=\_118). Exploratory
        and confirmatory factor analyses in the first sample supported a two-factor

        the factor structure. Significant negative correlations between both parental

        the convergent validity of the scale. Discriminant validity was indicated
        by a significant unique association between higher levels of DPC and child

        the Flu have made significant inroads into correlating social media trends
        to case counts and prevalence of epidemics in a population. There is a disconnect
        between data-driven methods for forecasting Flu incidence and epidemiological
        models that adopt a state based understanding of transitions, that can lead
        to sub-optimal predictions. Furthermore, models for epidemiological activity
        and social activity like on Twitter predict different shapes and have important
        differences. In this paper, we propose two temporal topic models (one unsupervised
        model as well as one improved weakly-supervised model) to capture hidden states
        of a user from his tweets and aggregate states in a geographical region for
        better estimation of trends. We show that our approaches help fill the gap
        between phenomenological methods for disease surveillance and epidemiological
        models. We validate our approaches by modeling the Flu using Twitter in multiple
        countries of South America. We demonstrate that our models can consistently
        outperform plain vocabulary assessment in Flu case-count predictions, and
        at the same time get better Flu-peak predictions than competitors. We also
        show that our fine-grained modeling can reconcile some contrasting behaviors

        and population-based CRC characteristics in Mississippi are investigated to
        reveal the geographic disparity in CRC screening.MethodsThe primary practice
        sites of licensed gastroenterologists and the addresses of licensed medical
        facilities offering on-site colonoscopies were verified via telephone surveys,
        then these CRC screening resource data were geocoded and analyzed using Geographic
        Information Systems. Correlation analyses were performed to detect the strength
        of associations between CRC screening resources, CRC screening behavior and
        CRC outcome data.ResultsAge-adjusted colorectal cancer incidence rates, mortality
        rates, mortality-to-incidence ratios, and self-reported endoscopic screening
        rates from the years 2006 through 2010 were significantly different for Black
        and White Mississippians; Blacks fared worse than Whites in all categories
        throughout all nine Public Health Districts. CRC screening rates were negatively
        correlated with CRC incidence rates and CRC mortality rates. The availability

        population-based and geographic disparities in CRC screening behaviors and
        CRC outcomes exist in Mississippi. The effects of CRC screening resources
        are related to CRC screening behaviors and outcomes at a regional level, whereas
        at the county level, socioeconomic factors are more strongly associated with

        a tactile stimulus its original skin-based, anatomical spatial code has to
        be transformed into an external, posture-dependent reference frame, a process
        known as tactile remapping. When the limbs are crossed, anatomical and external
        location codes are in conflict, leading to a decline in tactile localization
        accuracy. It is unknown whether this impairment originates from the integration
        of the resulting external localization response with the original, anatomical
        one or from a failure of tactile remapping in crossed postures. We fitted
        probabilistic models based on these diverging accounts to the data from three
        tactile localization experiments. Hand crossing disturbed tactile left\u2013right
        location choices in all experiments. Furthermore, the size of these crossing
        effects was modulated by stimulus configuration and task instructions. The
        best model accounted for these results by integration of the external response
        mapping with the original, anatomical one, while applying identical integration
        weights for uncrossed and crossed postures. Thus, the model explained the
        data without assuming failures of remapping. Moreover, performance differences
        across tasks were accounted for by non-individual parameter adjustments, indicating
        that individual participants\u2019 task adaptation results from one common
        functional mechanism. These results suggest that remapping is an automatic
        and accurate process, and that the observed localization impairments in touch
        result from a cognitively controlled integration process that combines anatomically
        and externally coded responses.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10384-015-0414-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10384-015-0414-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10384-015-0414-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10384-015-0414-0\"}],\"title\":\"Erratum

        Behavioral Healthcare (OBH) has arisen to fill a gap in mental health treatment.
        While research shows large positive changes in adolescent self-reports, little
        is known about predictors of change, longitudinal outcomes, and parent-reports
        of change.ObjectiveThis study sought to identify treatment outcomes up to
        18\_months post-discharge and predictors of change for parents of adolescent
        clients in OBH treatment.MethodsParents of 659 adolescents from four OBH programs
        were invited to complete questionnaires at intake, discharge, and 6 and 18\_months
        post-discharge. A regression was conducted to examine change during treatment,
        and a multilevel model to examine trajectories of change post-treatment.ResultsOBH
        participants entered treatment with clinically significant levels of emotional
        and behavioral dysfunction, made significant change during the program, and
        discharged within the \u201Cnormal\u201D range of functioning. Post-discharge
        scores indicated that clients remained in the \u201Cnormal\u201D range of
        functioning 6 and 18\_months post-discharge. The regression analysis found
        that parent intake scores and attachment disorders were predictive of in-treatment
        change. The MLM found that parent perceptions of treatment gains and adoption
        status were significant predictors of functioning post-discharge.ConclusionsResults
        are in-line with previous research suggesting that OBH may be helpful to adolescents
        experiencing a wide range of presenting problems, and adds new insights as
        well. Parent-reports parallel the dramatic changes in adolescent self-reports
        documented throughout OBH literature; data up to 18\_months post-treatment
        shows healthy functioning per the parent perspective; and adoption and attachment
        appear to play a role in outcome trajectories.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s12889-015-2222-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s12889-015-2222-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s12889-015-2222-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2222-3\"}],\"title\":\"Strategies

        health access will not be achieved unless women are cared for in their own
        communities and are empowered to take decisions about their own health in
        a supportive environment. This will only be achieved by community-based demand
        side interventions for maternal health access. In this review article, we
        highlight three common strategies to increase demand-side barriers to maternal
        healthcare access and identify the main challenges that still need to be addressed
        for these strategies to be effective.DiscussionCommon demand side strategies
        can be grouped into three categories:(i) Financial incentives/subsidies; (ii)
        Enhancing patient transfer, and; (iii) Community involvement. The main challenges
        in assessing the effectiveness or efficacy of these interventions or strategies
        are the lack of quality evidence on their outcome and impact and interventions
        not integrated into existing health or community systems. However, what is
        highlighted in this review and overlooked in most of the published literature
        on this topic is the lack of knowledge about the context in which these strategies

        effectively improve access to maternal health services. These include: addressing

        hydrogen sintering and phase transformation (HSPT) process is a novel powder
        metallurgy method for producing Ti alloys, particularly the Ti-6Al-4V alloy,
        with ultra-fine microstructure in the as-sintered state. The ultra-fine microstructure
        is obtained as a direct result of the use of H_2 gas during sintering. The
        refinement of the microstructure during HSPT is similar to that of thermal
        hydrogen processing (THP) of bulk Ti alloys. For both THP and HSPT of Ti-6Al-4V
        alloy, the mechanisms of the grain refinement depend on the phase equilibria
        and phase transformations in the presence of hydrogen, which are surprisingly
        still not well established to date and are still subjected to research and
        debate. In recent work by the present authors, a pseudo-binary phase diagram
        of (Ti-6Al-4V)-H has been determined by using in situ synchrotron XRD and
        TGA/DSC techniques. Aided by this phase diagram, the current paper focuses
        on the series of phase transformations during sintering and cooling of Ti-6Al-4V
        in a hydrogen atmosphere and the mechanisms for the formation of the ultra-fine
        microstructures obtained. Using experimental techniques, including in situ
        synchrotron XRD, SEM, EBSD, and TEM, the microstructural refinement was found
        to be the result of (1) the precipitation of ultra-fine \u03B1/\u03B1_2 within

        order to get reliable data to facilitate the hospital\u2019s obstetric audit
        a retrospective medical record study was performed in Ndala Hospital, Tanzania.MethodsAll
        patients diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia between July 2011
        and December 2012 were included. Medical records were searched immediately
        following discharge or death. General patient characteristics, medical history,
        obstetrical history, possible risk factors, information about the current
        pregnancy, antenatal clinic attendance and prescribed therapy before admission
        were recorded. Symptoms and complications were noted. Statistical analysis
        was done with Epi Info\xAE.ResultsOf the 3398 women who gave birth in the
        hospital 26 cases of severe pre-eclampsia and 55 cases of eclampsia were diagnosed
        (0.8 and 1.6\_%). Six women with eclampsia died (case fatality rate 11\_%).
        Convulsions in patients with eclampsia were classified as antepartum (44\_%),
        intrapartum (42\_%) and postpartum (15\_%). Magnesium was given in 100\_%
        of patients with eclampsia and was effective in controlling convulsions. Intravenous
        antihypertensive treatment was only started in 5\_% of patients. Induction
        of labour was done in 29 patients (78\_% of women who were not yet in labour).
        Delivery was spontaneous in 67\_%, assisted vaginal (ventouse) in 14\_% and
        by Caesarean section in 19\_% of women. Perinatal deaths occurred in 30\_%
        of women with eclampsia and 27\_% of women with severe pre-eclampsia and were
        associated with low birth weight and prolonged time between admission and

        Mediterranean ecosystem characterized by intense geothermal activity. Among
        the higher plants present in the area, this species appears to be the sole
        to possess the ability to grow near the geothermal sources. The hot fluid
        springs strongly alter the environment in their proximity: the emitted water
        vapor, CO_2, H_2S, CH_4, H_3BO_3, SO_4 ^2\u2212, and NH_4 ^+ partly condensate
        and precipitate to the soil, thus leading to its extreme acidification and
        nutrient depletion. Furthermore, the temperature starts to rise sharply just
        a few centimeters under the soil surface. Under this multiple stress, the
        individuals of C. vulgaris growing within a few meters from the springs showed
        lower photosystem II efficiency, higher oxidative damage to the biomembranes,
        and lower stomatal conductance than the individuals growing farther away.
        Drought and high air temperatures occurring in summer exacerbate these harsh

        that the main factors of stress are related to the physical and chemical features
        of the soil, while the adverse climate conditions apparently are of secondary

        rates were maintained over the last 10\_years and if a less experienced neurosurgeon,
        trained in and practicing in the same environment, could achieve similar outcomes.MethodsAll
        craniosynostosis operations performed in children between 2004 and 2015 were
        reviewed retrospectively. Transfusion rates were calculated. Analyses examined
        the relationship of transfusion to craniosynostosis type, surgical procedure,
        redo operation, surgeon, and perioperative hemoglobin levels.ResultsTwo hundred
        eighteen patients were included: 71 open sagittal, 28 endoscopic-assisted
        sagittal, 32 unicoronal, 14 bicoronal, 42 metopic, and 31 multisuture. Median
        age at operation was 9.1\_months. Overall transfusion rate was 24\_%: 17\_%
        open sagittal, 7\_% endoscopic-assisted sagittal, 6\_% unicoronal, 21\_% bicoronal,
        45\_% metopic, and 45\_% multisuture. The timing of transfusions were 75,
        21, and 4\_% for intraoperative, postoperative, and both, respectively. Patients
        not receiving transfusion had a mean lowest hemoglobin of 87\_g/l (range 61\u2013111)
        intraoperatively and 83\_g/l (range 58\u2013115) postoperatively. Mean lowest
        hemoglobin values were significantly lower in those necessitating intraoperative
        (75\_g/l, range 54\u2013102) or postoperative (59\_g/l, range 51\u201371)
        transfusions. There was no significant difference in transfusion rate between
        less and more experienced surgeons. There were no cardiovascular complications
        or mortalities.ConclusionIn craniosynostosis surgery, reproducible, long-term
        low blood transfusion rates were able to be maintained at a single center
        by careful intraoperative technique and acceptance of low intraoperative and
        postoperative hemoglobin levels in hemodynamically stable patients. Furthermore,
        low rates were also achieved by an inexperienced neurosurgeon in the group.
        This suggests that these results may be achievable by other neurosurgeons,

        analysis shows that an area of 7514.10\_km^2 (29.22\_% of total forest cover)
        has been affected by forest fires. Six major forest types are distributed
        in Andhra Pradesh, i.e. semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry
        evergreen, thorn and mangroves. Of the total forest burnt area, dry deciduous
        forests account for \\u003e75\_%. District-wise analysis shows that Kurnool,
        Prakasam and Cuddapah have shown \\u003e100\_km^2 of burnt area every year.
        The total forest burnt area estimate covering protected areas ranges between
        6.9 and 22.3\_% during the study period. Spatial burnt area analysis for protected
        areas in 2014 indicates 37.2\_% of fire incidences in the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam
        Tiger Reserve followed by 20.2\_% in the Sri Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary,
        20.1\_% in the Sri Venkateswara Wildlife Sanctuary and 17.4\_% in the Gundla
        Brahmeswaram Wildlife Sanctuary. The analysis of cumulative fire occurrences
        from 2009 to 2014 has helped in delineation of conservation priority hotspots
        using a spatial grid cell approach. Conservation priority hotspots I and II
        are distributed in major parts of study area including protected areas of
        the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve and Gundla Brahmeswaram Wildlife
        Sanctuary. The spatial database generated will be useful in studies related
        to influence of fires on species adaptability, ecological damage assessment
        and conservation planning.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10853-015-9401-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10853-015-9401-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10853-015-9401-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-9401-6\"}],\"title\":\"Ag_2S

        of the effects of language-focused interventions in pre-kindergarten settings
        by examining impacts on both lower- and higher-level language skills as well
        as overall language comprehension.ObjectiveThe goal is to assess the impacts
        of business-as-usual pre-kindergarten with implementation of two versions
        of an experimental curriculum supplement, Let\u2019s Know!, designed to enhance
        three component language skills (vocabulary, comprehension monitoring, and
        text-structure knowledge) and overall language comprehension in pre-kindergarteners.MethodsEleven
        pre-kindergarten teachers and 49 low socioeconomic-status students participated.
        Teachers were randomly assigned to either business-as-usual, Let\u2019s Know!
        Broad, or Let\u2019s Know! Deep, unless they participated in a previous pilot
        study, in which case they were randomly assigned to either Let\u2019s Know!
        Broad or Deep. The Broad version included five different lesson types, whereas
        the Deep version included three lesson types with additional practice. Children\u2019s
        gains were assessed proximally with measures of vocabulary, comprehension
        monitoring, and text-structure knowledge and distally with a measure of language
        comprehension.ResultsChildren in both experimental versions significantly
        improved their vocabulary skills relative to children who received business-as-usual
        instruction. For comprehension monitoring, children who received the Deep
        and Broad versions improved their scores relative to BAU children for Units
        1 and 3, respectively. Improvement in language comprehension was only found

        The first two articles report studies investigating factors associated with
        interest in genetic testing and acceptance of test results (Sherman et al.

        on beliefs about disease control and prevention (Aspinwall et al. in J Behav

        and sulphides, either physically remobilised and forming veinlets close to
        the massive sulphides, or hydrothermally transported and redeposited within
        the foliation. In situ laser ablation ICP-MS indicates that Pd and Pt are
        hosted within these nickel sulfarsenides. This Ni-Co-As-Pd geochemical halo,
        observed around the Sarah\u2019s Find ore body, is interpreted as forming
        syn deformation, by the circulation of As-rich hydrothermal fluids dissolving
        base metals, Pd and Pt from the orebody and redepositing them along the sheared
        footwall contact. Similar Ni-Co-Pd-Pt-As geochemical haloes could potentially
        exist around any magmatic nickel sulphide mineral system that has undergone
        a phase of arsenic metasomatism and may be a generally applicable proximity
        indicator for nickel sulphides in hydrothermally altered terranes.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5293-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5293-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5293-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5293-x\"}],\"title\":\"Defluoridation

        by activated alumina is considered to be one of the most practiced methods
        for defluoridation of freshwater. This study was conducted, therefore, to
        investigate the effect of natural organic matters (NOMs) on the removal of
        fluoride by activated alumina using response surface methodology. To the authors\u2019
        knowledge, this has not been previously investigated. Physico-chemical characterization
        of the alumina was determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller
        (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray fluorescence
        (XRF), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Response surface methodology (RSM)
        was applied to evaluate the effect of single and combined parameters on the
        independent variables such as the initial concentration of fluoride, NOMs,
        and pH on the process. The results revealed that while presence of NOM and
        increase of pH enhance fluoride adsorption on the activated alumina, initial
        concentration of fluoride has an adverse effect on the efficiency. The experimental
        data were analyzed and found to be accurately and reliably fitted to a second-order
        polynomial model. Under optimum removal condition (fluoride concentration
        20\_mg/L, NOM concentration 20\_mg/L, and pH 7) with a desirability value
        of 0.93 and fluoride removal efficiency of 80.6\_%, no significant difference
        was noticed with the previously reported sequence of the co-exiting ion affinity
        to activated alumina for fluoride removal. Moreover, aluminum residual was
        found to be below the recommended value by the guideline for drinking water.
        Also, the increase of fluoride adsorption on the activated alumina, as NOM
        concentrations increase, could be due to the complexation between fluoride
        and adsorbed NOM.

        L., T. hybridum L., T. incarnatum L., T. resupinatum var. majus Boiss., and
        T. resupinatum var. resupinatum L. Chemical profiles of the extracts contained
        three or four groups of (poly)phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, clovamides,
        isoflavones, and other flavonoids. Antioxidant properties of Trifolium extracts
        were assessed as the efficacy to reduce oxidative and nitrative damage to
        blood platelets, exposed to 100\_\u03BCM peroxynitrite-induced oxidative stress
        in vitro. Antioxidant actions of the examined extracts were determined by
        the following biomarkers of oxidative stress: thiol groups, 3-nitrotyrosine,
        lipid hydroperoxides, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances\_(TBARS).
        Despite the significant differences in the chemical composition (the total
        phenolic concentrations varied between 11.30 and 52.55\_mg/g of dry mass)
        of Trifolium extracts, we observed noticeable protective effects of almost
        all tested plant preparations. The T. alexandrinum extract, containing the
        highest concentration of phenols, was the most effective antioxidant among
        the tested extracts. On the other hand, the T. incarnatum extract, which contained
        a comparable total phenolic content (49.77\_mg/g), was less efficient in prevention
        of tyrosine nitration and generation of TBARS. These findings indicate on
        the important role of individual phenolic components of the examined clover

        inner structure of sliding soil is quite inhomogeneous, which makes it very
        hard to investigate the mechanical properties. In this paper, intact sliding
        soil samples collected from the Huangtupo landslide is verified to be rock
        and soil aggregates (RSA) firstly. Because of the grain-size limitations for
        general indoor shear tests and the unpredictability of test data obtained
        by reshaped sample, a new method which combines CT scanning for undisturbed
        samples, mechanical tests for fine-grained subdomain and numerical test is
        proposed. With the advantages of repeatability and parallel comparison, deep
        research into the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms for sliding
        soil is carried out. The research shows that, for the RSA in this paper, which
        the coarse particles content is about 30\_%, fine-grained subdomain is still
        the frame part of RSA, compared with pure fine-grained soil, the internal
        friction angle does not obviously increase, but the cohesion increased by
        at least 80\_%. Meanwhile, coupling deformation between coarse particles and
        fine-grained subdomain is a complex mechanical process; coarse particles will
        support an effective resistance to the fine fraction, and in Mohr-Coulomb
        model, it is reflected by obvious increase of cohesion. Based on the mechanical
        trace preservations on a block of gravel, this external friction effect is
        verified. Then, by seven groups of large-size stacked ring shear test for
        the RSA samples, these analyses and judgements are verified. The comprehensive

        birth weight is a good health indicator for any population. In the recent
        past, there have been many reports in the West indicating that there has been
        an increase in the proportion of large for gestational age (LGA) babies. The
        objective is to describe the change in the incidence of LGA babies from 1996
        to 2010 in South India and the maternal risk factors.MethodsA rotational sampling
        scheme was used, i.e., the 12\_months of the year were divided into 4 quarters
        and a month was from each quarter was selected rotationally. All deliveries
        for that month were considered. Only deliveries that occurred between 28 and
        42\_weeks of pregnancy were considered. The association between risk variables
        was studied using multivariable logistic regression.ResultsThere were 35,718
        deliveries that occurred during these 15-year-study period in the gestational
        age 28\u201342\_weeks were registered through the outpatient clinics. The

        hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) of shrimps is an important disease,
        first appeared in China in 2009. Since then, AHPND has caused serious drops
        in shrimp production (up to 20\_% worldwide). Although AHPND [originally termed
        as acute hepatopancreatic necrosis syndrome (AHPNS)] first appeared in 2009,
        it was not until 2013 that a laboratory infection model was devised and the
        causative agent identified as certain strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus .
        AHPND has caused mortality from 40 to 100\_% which usually occurs early (within
        approximately 35\_days) after stocking shrimp fry in shrimp ponds; therefore,
        it was initially referred to as early mortality syndrome (EMS). Confusingly,
        other pathogens and environmental factors also cause EMS and are often attributed
        to AHPND by shrimp farmers. Frequently, farmers do not send samples for confirmatory
        tests requiring detection of the unique histopathology at the acute stage
        of disease (massive sloughing of hepatopancreatic epithelial cells without
        any accompanying signs of a pathogen). The gross signs presumptive of AHPND
        (lethargy, slow growth, empty stomach and midgut, and a pale to white, atrophied
        hepatopancreas) are insufficient for confirmatory diagnosis. Recently, molecular
        detection of AHPND bacteria using PCR has been developed, which has sped up
        diagnosis and increased research on the causative agent, alternative detection
        methods, and possible therapies. We hope that this review of research progress
        on AHPND will serve as a useful introduction for researchers who are currently
        unfamiliar with AHPND, but have backgrounds in bacterial virulence, detection,
        and epidemiology, and may be encouraged to participate in the research effort
        to reduce AHPND\u2019s impact on shrimp cultivation.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1245/s10434-015-4844-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1245/s10434-015-4844-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1245/s10434-015-4844-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1245/s10434-015-4844-1\"}],\"title\":\"Sarcoma

        surface waters of Guilan, Mazandaran, Alborz, and Tehran provinces, in Iran.
        For the isolation of Acanthamoeba species, approximately 500\_ml of the water
        samples were filtered through a cellulose nitrate membrane with a pore size
        of 0.45\_\u03BC. The filter was transferred onto non-nutrient agar plates
        seeded with Gram-negative bacteria ( Escherichia coli ) as a food source.
        The presence of Acanthamoeba was confirmed by the genus-specific primer pair
        JDP1 and 2, and/or NA primers were used to identify Acanthamoeba and certain
        other free-living amoebae. In total, 38 out of 49 samples were positive by
        culture and/or PCR for Acanthamoeba and other free-living amoebae from all
        three provinces. By sequencing the positive isolates, the strains were shown
        to belong to Acanthamoeba (16 isolates belonged to T4 and 2 isolates belonged
        to T5), Hartmannella vermiformis (3/24), and Saccamoeba limax (2/24). The

        is an interdisciplinary scientific field not only focused on the search of
        extraterrestrial life, but also on deciphering the key environmental parameters
        that have enabled the emergence of life on Earth. Understanding these physical
        and chemical parameters is fundamental knowledge necessary not only for discovering
        life or signs of life on other planets, but also for understanding our own
        terrestrial environment. Therefore, astrobiology pushes us to combine different
        perspectives such as the conditions on the primitive Earth, the physicochemical
        limits of life, exploration of habitable environments in the Solar System,
        and the search for signatures of life in exoplanets. Chemists, biologists,
        geologists, planetologists and astrophysicists are contributing extensively
        to this interdisciplinary research field. From 2011 to 2014, the European
        Space Agency (ESA) had the initiative to gather a Topical Team of interdisciplinary
        scientists focused on astrobiology to review the profound transformations
        in the field that have occurred since the beginning of the new century. The
        present paper is an interdisciplinary review of current research in astrobiology,
        covering the major advances and main outlooks in the field. The following
        subjects will be reviewed and most recent discoveries will be highlighted:
        the new understanding of planetary system formation including the specificity
        of the Earth among the diversity of planets, the origin of water on Earth
        and its unique combined properties among solvents for the emergence of life,
        the idea that the Earth could have been habitable during the Hadean Era, the
        inventory of endogenous and exogenous sources of organic matter and new concepts
        about how chemistry could evolve towards biological molecules and biological
        systems. In addition, many new findings show the remarkable potential life
        has for adaptation and survival in extreme environments. All those results
        from different fields of science are guiding our perspectives and strategies

        is an important health assessment measure with many applications. In the medical
        practice and in research settings, height is typically measured with a stadiometer.
        Although lasers are commonly used by health professionals for measurement
        including facial imaging, corneal thickness, and limb length, it has not been
        utilized for measuring height. The purpose of this feasibility study was to
        examine the ease and accuracy of a laser device for measuring height in children
        and adults.FindingsIn immediate succession, participant height was measured
        in triplicate using a stadiometer followed by the laser device. Measurement
        error for the laser device was significantly higher than that for the stadiometer
        (0.35 and 0.20 cm respectively). However, the measurement techniques were
        highly correlated ( r ^2\u2009=\u20090.998 and 0.990 for the younger [\\u003c12
        y, n \u2009=\u200925] and older [\u226512 y, n \u2009=\u2009100] participants
        respectively), and the estimated reliability between measurement techniques
        was 0.999 (ICC; 95 % CI: 0.998,1.000) and 0.995 (ICC; 95 % CI: 0.993,0.997)
        for the younger and older groups respectively. The average differences between
        the two styles of measurement (e.g., stadiometer minus laser) were significantly
        different from zero: +0.93 and +0.45 cm for the younger and older groups respectively.ConclusionsThese
        data demonstrate that laser technology can be adapted to measure height in
        children and adults. Although refinement is needed, the laser device for measuring
        height merits further development.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10853-015-9375-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10853-015-9375-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10853-015-9375-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-9375-4\"}],\"title\":\"Effect

        drugs are known to cause physical and cognitive impairment, particularly in
        older patients. The total of all anticholinergic influences to which a patient
        is exposed is referred to as anticholinergic load. Because the anticholinergic
        load is defined in various ways, this review aimed to describe differences
        in the development and evaluation of available methods calculating the anticholinergic
        load.MethodsFrom September 2014 to August 2015, two reviewers performed a
        literature search in PubMed considering relevant items of the Preferred Reporting
        Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. We aimed
        to identify articles which calculated the anticholinergic load with a scale
        or equation and investigated its association with patient-related outcomes.
        From the included studies, we descriptively analyzed the identification and
        scoring criteria of the scales and equations with a main emphasis on their
        association to the reported outcomes.ResultsOut of 465 articles, 55 were included
        referring to 12 scales and one equation. Main discrepancies were located in
        eight different identification criteria for anticholinergic drugs, two different
        scoring principles, and 118 tests used for assessing outcomes. The methods
        most frequently detecting a significant association between the anticholinergic
        load and outcomes took into account the drugs\u2019 dosages and anticholinergic
        potencies. Interestingly, none of the methods included the patient\u2019s
        susceptibility for anticholinergic effects and they only rarely considered
        modulators of drug exposure.ConclusionsDue to hugely varying tests for assessing
        outcomes, the methods are scarcely comparable. For a more valuable comparison,
        the anticholinergic load should be calculated with all scales and the equation

        article reflects on context effects in the study of behavioral ethics and
        organizational justice. After a general overview, we review three key challenges
        confronting research in these two domains. First, we consider social scientific
        versus normative approaches to inquiry. The former aims for a scientific description,
        while the latter aims to provide prescriptive advice for moral conduct. We
        argue that the social scientific view can be enriched by considering normative
        paradigms. The next challenge we consider, involves the duality of morally
        upright versus morally inappropriate behavior. We observe that there is a
        long tradition of categorizing behavior dichotomously (e.g., good vs. bad)
        rather than continuously. We conclude by observing that more research is needed
        to compare the dichotomous versus continuous perspectives. Third, we examine
        the role of \u201Ccold\u201D cognitions and \u201Chot\u201D affect in making
        judgments of ethicality. Historically speaking, research has empathized cognition,
        though recent work has begun to add greater balance to affective reactions.
        We argue that both cognition and affect are important, but more research is
        needed to determine how they work together. After considering these three
        challenges, we then turn to our special issue, providing short reviews of

        adoption of Agrobacterium -mediated transformation to agronomically important
        Carica papaya cultivars and genotypes, such as \u201CKapoho\u2019, has been
        challenging. To address this problem, an alternative transformation protocol
        was developed for papaya using embryogenic suspension-derived cultures. The
        ability of the tissues (cultivar \u2018Kapoho\u2019) to regenerate plantlets
        from these cultures was demonstrated for both transgenic lines and untransformed
        controls. Suspension-derived cultures at the young globular calli stage contained
        embryos highly receptive to Agrobacterium infection and did not require the
        problematic wounding treatments inherent in other protocols. The optimum parameters
        selected to obtain transgenic calli were as follows: 1-d co-cultivation with
        Agrobacterium , the cell density used for transformation was A_600 of 0.005,
        and elimination of Agrobacterium post-transformation was done using 250\_mg/L
        carbenicillin and cefotaxime. Putative transgenic calli were confirmed positive
        for the presence of the eGFP transgene, Cp45 promoter sequence, and hygromycin
        resistance gene ( hptII ) using PCR. The presence of eGFP messenger RNA (mRNA)
        and protein were detected using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and Western
        blot analysis, respectively. Visualization of qualitative eGFP fluorescence
        in roots, stems, and leaves further confirmed the expression of Cp45:eGFP
        fusion in the transformed papaya plantlets. This technique serves as an alternative
        and efficient method to generate transgenic plants in a simple laboratory
        setup that facilitates Agrobacterium -mediated transformation of previously

        little information is available on helminth community structure in tadpoles,
        the ephemeral, feeding, non-reproductive larva stages of anurans. We examined
        the helminth community structure in tadpoles of northern leopard frogs, Rana
        pipiens , and Woodhouse\u2019s toads, Bufo woodhousii , from a first-order
        stream in Western Nebraska. Specifically, we were interested in how species-specific
        difference in size, time to metamorphosis, and habitat partitioning among
        larval anurans affect their helminth community structure. From June\u2013July
        2009, we collected 30 tadpoles of northern leopard frogs, R. pipiens , and
        50 tadpoles of Woodhouse\u2019s toads, B. woodhousii , from Cedar Creek, Keith
        County, NE, USA. The compound helminth community was dominated by trematode
        metacercarial stages (echinostomatids and plagiorchids) and the nematode Gyrinicola
        batrachiensis with only a single non-gravid adult trematode, Gorgoderina attenuata
        , present in low numbers. The helminth component communities were depauperate
        and isolationist in nature, with a maximum of four helminth species/types
        per component community. Although no species-specific helminth infections
        were observed, clear differences were found in overall abundance of nematode
        versus trematode infections among tadpoles of these two anuran species. The
        component community of tadpoles of R. pipiens was dominated by nematodes,
        whereas the component community of tadpoles of B. woodhousii was dominated
        by trematodes. Although differences in tadpole susceptibility of these two
        anuran species could not be ruled out, differences in the reproductive strategy
        of G. batrachiensis in tadpoles of R. pipiens and B. woodhousii and anuran
        species-specific habitats partitioning among tadpoles of these two anuran
        species were important factors in structuring their helminth communities.
        Our study indicates that time to metamorphosis (older tadpoles) play a significant
        role in structuring helminth communities of tadpoles within species at the
        infracommunity level with older tadpoles having higher helminth species richness
        and/or abundances. However, species-specific differences in anuran tadpole
        habitat partitioning outweighed the effects of differences in time to metamorphosis
        at the component community level. Finally, our study is the first to report
        deformities in hind limb development in a tadpole from Nebraska. Of the 30
        northern leopard frog tadpoles collected, a single individual contained an
        extra hind limb and was infected with two plagiorchid metacercariae located
        in the musculature above the hind limbs.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5321-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5321-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5321-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5321-x\"}],\"title\":\"The

        the relationship between asthma and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
        has been frequently measured, reported conclusions have not been consistent.
        As emergency department (ED) visits are an effective way to estimate health
        outcomes for people with asthma and short-term exposure to PM2.5, this review
        systematically searched five databases without language or geographical restrictions
        from inception to January 13, 2015 to study the impact of PM2.5 on asthma
        ED visits. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled risk ratio
        (RR) and 95\_% confidence intervals (CI). With respect to short-term effects,
        asthma ED visits increased at higher PM2.5 concentrations (RR 1.5\_% per 10\_\u03BCg/m^3;
        95\_% CI 1.2\u20131.7\_%), and children were more susceptible (3.6\_% per
        10\_\u03BCg/m^3; 95\_% CI 1.8, 5.3\_%) than adults (1.7, 95\_% CI 0.7\_%,

        by 3.7\_% (95\_% CI 0.5, 6.9\_%) per 10\_\u03BCg/m^3 increase in PM2.5, which
        was higher than the corresponding increase during the cold season (2.6, 95\_%
        CI 0.7\u20134.6\_%). This demonstrates that ambient PM2.5 has an adverse impact
        on asthma ED visits after short-term exposure and that children are a high-risk
        population when PM2.5 concentrations are high, particularly in warm seasons,
        during which measures should be taken to prevent PM2.5.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12024-015-9712-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12024-015-9712-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12024-015-9712-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12024-015-9712-6\"}],\"title\":\"A

        neuromuscular disorders often have an increased risk of pneumonia and decreased
        lung function, which may further be compromised by scoliosis. Scoliosis surgery
        may improve pulmonary function in otherwise healthy patients, but no study
        has evaluated its effect on the risk of pneumonia in patients with neuromuscular
        scoliosis (NMS).MethodsThe patient charts of 42 patients (mean age 14.6\_years)
        who had undergone surgery for severe NMS (mean scoliosis 86\xB0) were retrospectively
        reviewed from birth to a mean of 6.1 years (range 2.8\u20139.5) after scoliosis
        surgery. The main outcome was radiographically confirmed pneumonia as a primary
        cause for hospitalization. We excluded postoperative (3\_months) pneumonia
        from the analyses.ResultsThe lifetime annual incidence of pneumonia was 8.0/100
        before and 13.4/100 after scoliosis surgery ( p \_\\u003e\_0.10). The mean
        number of hospital days per year due to pneumonia were 0.59 (SD 2.3) before
        scoliosis surgery and 2.24 (SD 6.9) after surgery ( p \_\\u003e\_0.10). Multivariate
        analysis demonstrated that lifetime risk factors for pneumonia were epilepsy
        (RR 15.2, 95\_% CI 1.3\u2013176.8, p \_=\_0.027), non-cerebral palsy (CP)
        etiology (RR\_=\_10.2, 95\_% CI 3.2\u201332.7, p \_\\u003c\_0.001) and major

        p \_=\_0.01).ConclusionsEpilepsy, non-CP etiology and major scoliosis are
        significant risk factors for pneumonia in patients with NMS. Scoliosis surgery
        does not decrease the incidence of pneumonia in patients with severe NMS.Level

        untersuchen die Adoption sozialer Innovation und erweitern instrumentelle
        Faktoren der Adoptionsabsicht um nicht-instrumentelle Faktoren. Wir gehen
        davon aus, dass aus einer marktbasierten Perspektive betrachtet konventionelle
        Innovationsadoptionsmodelle, die auf instrumentellen Faktoren beruhen, die
        spezifischen Merkmale sozialer Innovationen nicht vollst\xE4ndig ber\xFCcksichtigen.
        Unser Ziel ist es, die Erkl\xE4rungskraft konventioneller Adoptionsmodelle
        durch den Einschluss symbolischer, emotionaler und motivierender Faktoren
        als nicht-instrumentelle Faktoren zu erh\xF6hen. Wir f\xFChrten zwei empirische
        Studien durch, in denen wir die Adoptionsabsichten junger Erwachsener in Bezug
        auf Seniorengenossenschaften, die auf Time Banking basieren, untersuchten.
        Die Resultate erweitern die Ergebnisse konventioneller Adoptionsforschung
        und zeigen, dass die Erkl\xE4rungskraft durch den Einschluss nicht-instrumenteller
        Faktoren wesentlich verbessert werden kann. Die Ergebnisse tragen zu unserem
        Verst\xE4ndnis \xFCber die Adoption sozialer Innovation bei und weisen auf
        eine beschr\xE4nkte Verallgemeinerbarkeit der Forschung zu konventioneller
        Innovationsadoption auf soziale Innovationen hin. Implikationen und Hinweise
        f\xFCr zuk\xFCnftige Forschungen werden diskutiert.Chinese\u6211\u4EEC\u5BF9\u793E\u4F1A\u5BF9\u521B\u65B0\u7684\u91C7\u7EB3\u8FDB\u884C\u4E86\u8C03\u67E5,\u5E76\u901A\u8FC7\u628A\u975E\u5DE5\u5177\u6027\u56E0\u7D20\u5305\u62EC\u5728\u5185\u800C\u62D3\u5C55\u4E86\u91C7\u7EB3\u610F\u56FE\u7684\u5DE5\u5177\u6027\u56E0\u7D20\u3002

        investigate social innovation adoption and extend instrumental factors of
        adoption intention by including non-instrumental factors. We argue that, from
        a market-based perspective, conventional innovation adoption models based
        on instrumental factors do not fully consider specific characteristics of
        social innovations. Our objective is to improve the explanatory power of conventional
        adoption models by including symbolic, emotional, and motivational factors
        as non-instrumental factors. We conducted two empirical studies in which we
        investigated younger adults\u2019 adoption intentions regarding time-bank-based
        senior cooperatives. The results extend the findings of conventional adoption
        research and show that explanatory power can be substantially improved by
        including non-instrumental factors. The results contribute to the understanding
        of social innovation adoption and indicate limited generalizability of conventional
        innovation adoption research to social innovations. Implications and directions
        for future research are discussed.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11738-015-1955-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11738-015-1955-z\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11738-015-1955-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-015-1955-z\"}],\"title\":\"Antioxidant

        and \u2018Kenblue\u2019 (waterlogging-sensitive), were subjected to waterlogging
        for 28\_days (d) followed by 7 d of drainage recovery. Waterlogging stress
        increased malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide anion (O _2 ^\xB7\u2212 ) and
        hydrogen peroxide (H_2O_2) in both cultivars. Moonlight exhibited greater
        turfgrass quality (TQ) rating and chlorophyll (Chl) content than Kenblue during
        the waterlogging and drainage period. After 7 d of drainage, all physiological
        parameters returned to the control level for Moonlight, but not for Kenblue.
        Higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate
        peroxidase (APX) as well as more abundance of isozymes were found in Moonlight
        relative to Kenblue under waterlogging stress. Moonlight showed higher SOD
        and APX activity and isozymes intensity when compared with Kenblue during
        the drainage period. The transcript levels of chloroplastic Cu/ZnSOD (Chl
        Cu/ZnSOD ), MnSOD , FeSOD , POD and cytosolic APX (Cyt APX ) were higher in
        Moonlight relative to Kenblue under waterlogging conditions, and higher transcript
        activities of Chl Cu/ZnSOD , FeSOD and Cyt APX were observed in Moonlight

        polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are health risks to human, as they
        can be toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic. As the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is
        one of the major petroleum-producing countries, they inevitably suffer from
        worsening this environmental problem. Therefore, removal of these compounds

        54 bacterial isolates were obtained by enrichment techniques from oil-contaminated
        soil samples. Out of them, seven gram-negative bacterial strains, KKU-J1,
        KKU-J2, KKU-J4, KKU-J7, KKU-J9, KKU-J14 and KKU-J17, exhibiting ability for
        petroleum PAHs degradation were selected. The isolates showing the highest
        growth during screening as demonstrated by the increase in their optical densities
        (OD_600) and a concentration-dependent growth in all examined PAH compounds
        that grew in it, with strains KKU-J2, KKU-J7 and KKU-J17 were the best. The
        highest optimum growth rate of $${0.333 \\\\pm 0.0, 0.364 \\\\pm 0.016}$$
        0.333 \xB1 0.0 , 0.364 \xB1 0.016 and $${0.357 \\\\pm 0.004 ({\\\\rm OD}_{600})}$$
        0.357 \xB1 0.004 ( OD 600 ) was recorded for the strains KKU-J2, KKU-J7 and
        KKU-J17, respectively, when the level of phenanthrene was 100\_mg/l. On the
        other hand, strain KKU-J2 was found to be the best one ( $${0.413 \\\\pm 0.0}$$
        0.413 \xB1 0.0 ) when the level of naphthalene was 100\_mg/l. Molecular identification
        of the selected isolates was detected based on 16S rRNA gene amplification
        and partial sequence determination. Alignment results and the comparison of
        16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates to the 16S rRNA gene sequences available
        in GenBank database, as well as the phylogenetic analysis, confirmed the accurate
        position of the isolates as Sphingomonas paucimobilis KKU-J1, Pseudomonas
        alcaligenes KKU-J2, Micrococcus antarcticus KKU-J4, Arthrobacter oxydans KKU-J7,
        Stenotrophomonas rhizophila KKU-J9, Kocuria rhizophila KKU-J14 and Shinella
        zoogloeoides KKU-J17. RAPD\u2013PCR fingerprinting was carried out for the
        seven isolates, and the DNA patterns revealed that there is no correlation
        between the RAPD profile and geographic origin sites where these isolates
        were collected from. This study indicates that the contaminated soil samples
        contain a diverse population of PAH-degrading bacteria, and the use of soil-associated
        microorganisms could be recommended for PAHs bioremediation in the environment.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s13020-015-0057-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s13020-015-0057-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13020-015-0057-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13020-015-0057-6\"}],\"title\":\"Lectin

        (e.g., molecular size, biological activities) that deserve further investigation.
        This study aims to investigate the basic properties (e.g., molecular size,
        amino acid sequence, sugar specificity) and biological activities (e.g., antiproliferative
        activity) of GSLL.MethodsGSLL was purified by successive fractionation on
        SP-Sepharose, Affi-gel blue gel, Mono Q, and Superdex 75. The biochemical
        properties of GSLL were investigated by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, N-terminal
        amino acid sequencing, and sugar inhibition tests. For the biological activities,
        purified lyophilized GSLL was sterilized, adjusted to concentrations from
        1 to 0\_mg/mL (by twofold serial dilution) in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s
        medium with fetal bovine serum, and examined by using the MTT assay, flow
        cytometry, and western blotting after treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma
        CNE1 and CNE2 cell lines\_with the lectin.ResultsGSLL appeared as a 21-kDa
        band in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. It was composed of two subunits with molecular
        sizes of 17 and ~4\_kDa. It exhibited specificity in binding to glucose and
        mannose, as well as glucosides and mannosides. Mass spectrometry and N-terminal
        amino acid sequencing revealed similarity of GSLL to L. culinaris lectin (LcL),
        especially higher coverage of the \u03B2-chain of LcL. A 48-h treatment with
        GSLL exerted antiproliferative effects on nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE1 and
        CNE2 cell lines with significant inhibition at 0.125\_mg/mL ( P \_\\u003c\_0.001)
        and 1\_mg/mL ( P \_=\_0.004), respectively, and these effects were attenuated
        in the presence of glucose and mannose. GSLL induced apoptosis in nasopharyngeal
        carcinoma CNE1 cells, with detectable phosphatidylserine externalization,
        mitochondrial depolarization, and cell cycle arrest. Western blot analysis
        suggested that GSLL triggered the extrinsic apoptotic pathway involving caspase
        3, 8, and 9 in CNE1 cells.ConclusionGSLL possessed some different properties

        is to determine if the increase in the suicide rate in Catalonia, Spain from
        2010 onwards has been statistically significant and whether it is associated
        with rising unemployment.MethodsWe used hierarchical mixed models, separately
        considering the crude death rate of suicides for municipalities with more
        than and less than 10,000 inhabitants as dependent variables both unstratified
        and stratified according to gender and/or age group.ResultsIn municipalities
        with 10,000 or more inhabitants there was an increase in the relative risk
        of suicide from 2009 onwards. This increase was only statistically significant
        for working-aged women (16\u201364 years). In municipalities with less than
        10,000 inhabitants the relative risk showed a decreasing trend even after
        2009. In no case did we find the unemployment rate to be associated (statistically
        significant) with the suicide rate.ConclusionsThe increase in the suicide

        with the exception of working-aged women (16\u201364 years) living in municipalities

        C virus (HCV) infection, termed non-B non-C HCC (nBnC-HCC), is reportedly
        correlated with better survival outcomes than HBV- or HCV-related HCC. However,
        the nBnC-HCC population includes patients with a history of HBV infection
        possessing anti-hepatitis B core antibodies (HBcAb), and the oncologic significance
        of this finding remains unclear.MethodsA retrospective review of the data
        for 562 patients who underwent curative resection for primary HCC was performed.
        The clinical outcomes were compared among the following four groups: HBV group
        (HBsAg-positive), HCV group (HCVAb-positive), HBcAb-positive nBnC-HCC group,
        and pure nBnC-HCC group (negative for these viral markers).ResultsThe HBcAb-positive
        nBnC-HCC group showed better overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival
        (RFS) rates than the HBV, HCV, and pure nBnC-HCC groups (5-year OS 89.4 vs

        paper considers the problem of computing general commutative and associative

        nodes in the system, and the topology among them is modeled as a general undirected
        graph. Whenever a node sends a message, the message is received by all of
        its neighbors in the graph. Each node has an input, and the goal is for a
        special root node (e.g., the base station in wireless sensor networks or the
        gateway node in wireless ad hoc networks) to learn a certain commutative and

        adaptive capacity, and exposure to climate change framed along two main axes
        of concern can help to identify potential strategies for conservation and
        adaptation decision-making, using a landscape in Madagascar\u2019s spiny forest
        as a case-study.MethodsTo apply such a vulnerability landscape assessment,
        we inferred the sensitivity of habitats using temporal and spatial botanical
        data-sets, including the use of fossil pollen data and vegetation surveys.
        For understanding adaptive capacity, we analysed existing spatial maps (reflecting
        anthropogenic stressors) showing the degree of habitat connectivity, matrix
        quality and protected area coverage for the different habitats in the landscape.
        Lastly, for understanding exposures, we used climate change predictions in
        Madagascar, together with a digital elevation model.ResultsThe fossil pollen
        data showed how sensitive arid-adapted species were to past climate changes,
        especially the conditions between 1000 and 500\_cal\_yr BP. The spatial analysis
        then helped locate habitats on the two-dimensional axes of concern integrating
        sensitivity, adaptive capacity and climate change exposure. By identifying
        resistant, resilient, susceptible, and sensitive habitats to climate change
        in the landscape under study, we identify very different approaches to integrate
        conservation and adaptation strategies in contrasting habitats.ConclusionThis

        RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor of GA signaling, and involved in GA-mediated
        regulation of cellulose synthesis pathway. Our findings revealed that OsMYB103L
        plays an important role in GA-regulating secondary cell wall synthesis, and

        increasing numbers of antibiotic resistances are putting more and more pressure
        on research and global health systems. Multidrug-resistant bacteria even escape
        from second-line antibiotics and only a few promising candidates are presently
        in the pipeline. Intrinsic resistance of bacteria mediated by efflux pumps
        play a crucial role in the development and implementation of resistances.
        Efflux pump inhibitors represent one possible way to overcome this decreasing
        sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics. The co-administration of such efflux
        pump inhibitors together with an antibiotic reduces the amount needed of the
        antibiotic for the same therapeutic effect by cutting side effects. These
        inhibitors have also the possibility to reactivate ineffective antibiotics
        again for therapy. Plants are facing constant bacterial exposure and are therefore
        a promising source for new efflux pump inhibitors due to the enormous compound
        diversity, low toxicity and high tolerability. Reviewing the literature, we
        herein present an update of newly discovered efflux pump inhibitors with plant-based
        origin against bacterial strains of concern. Various compounds from 23 different
        plants have been reported and evaluated for their potential as efflux pump
        inhibitors based on efflux and accumulation data. This review also discusses
        the hurdles of clinical implementation.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12024-015-9713-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12024-015-9713-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12024-015-9713-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12024-015-9713-5\"}],\"title\":\"Regarding

        ( R,S )-diethyl-2-[(dimethoxyphosphorothioyl)sulfanyl]butanedioate is a chiral
        organophosphorus compound used widely as pesticide for suppression of harmful
        insects such as mosquitoes. It is well known that in biological systems (
        R )-malathion is the active enantiomer, therefore a sustainable approach could
        be the use of only the biologically active enantiomer. The resolution of the
        commercial racemic mixture to obtain the pure active enantiomer combined with
        a recycling of the undesired enantiomer through a racemization process could
        be an attractive alternative to reduce the environmental impact of this pesticide.
        Thus, this work evaluates the use of four commercially available lipases for
        enantioselective hydrolysis and separation of malathion enantiomers from the
        commercial racemic mixture.ResultsSeveral lipases were methodologically assessed,
        considering parameters such as enzyme concentration, temperature and reaction
        rates. Among them, Candida rugosa lipase exhibited the best performance, in
        terms of enantioselectivity, E \u2009=\u2009185 (selective to the ( S )-enantiomer).
        In this way, the desired unreacted ( R )-enantiomer was recovered in a 49.42\_%
        yield with an enantiomeric excess of 87\_%. The monohydrolized ( S )-enantiomer
        was recovered and racemized in basic media, followed by esterification to
        obtain the racemic malathion, which was recycled. In this way, an enantioenriched
        mixture of ( R )-malathion was obtained with a conversion of 65.80\_% considering
        the recycled ( S )-enantiomer.ConclusionThis work demonstrated the feasibility
        of exploiting Candida rugosa lipase to kinetically resolve racemic malathion
        through an environmentally friendly recycling of the undesired ( S )-enantiomer.

        infection. To further the understanding of the dyadic factors that impact
        condom use among women, we investigated the impact of three relationship factors
        (i.e., power, fear, and dependence) on the association between HIV-related
        information, motivation, and behavioral skills [constructs from the information-motivation-behavioral
        skills (IMB) model] and condom use among abused women. Data from 133 urban,

        violence agencies, women\u2019s health organizations, hospitals, Department
        of Health and Human Services, and Family Court) showed that these women experienced
        high levels of IPV and that relationship power, fear of abuse, and partner
        dependence were all associated with condom use. Multivariable models revealed
        that fear of abuse and partner dependence moderated the association between
        IMB constructs and condom use but relationship power did not. Results highlight
        the critical need to incorporate strategies to address relationship factors

        reduction or conversion by clean technologies has always been a mission for
        environmental protection and sustainable development. A green, electrochemically
        driven conversion of SO_2 to NaHSO_4 from flue gas by pH variation was conducted.
        Experiments were carried out to investigate some factors affecting the conversion
        process, such as O_2 function in flue gas, selected initial pH (pH_0) of solution,
        and CO_2 effects of high concentration. Experimental results revealed that
        (i) O_2 was essential for SO_2 absorption, since the pH of solution was decreased
        more effectively than that of flue gas without O_2. The lowest pH of absorption
        solution with pouring O_2 was about 3.2, which was benefit to formatting HSO_3
        ^\u2212 but hindering absorption of CO_2. Meanwhile, O_2 from flue gas accelerated
        the adsorption of SO_2 for its oxidability to change HSO_3 ^\u2212 and SO_3
        ^2\u2212 ions into SO_4 ^2\u2212. (ii) At the conditions of different pH_0,
        the minimum absorption efficiency of SO_2 was 89.3\_%, corresponding to pH_0
        5.0 and 7.0, while maximum value was 100.1\_% corresponding to pH_0 6.0, which
        meant pH_0 6.0 was more appropriate for SO_2 conversion by electrochemistry
        under the experimental pH_0 range. (iii) The absorption efficiency of CO_2
        was at a very low level under conditions of pH_0 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0, whose
        value of minimum and maximum was 0.07 and 0.19\_%. The result showed that
        high concentration of CO_2 from flue gas had little affection on desulfurization
        under the experimental pH_0 range, which enable to infer that byproduct of
        NaHSO_4 is pure enough.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s40792-015-0081-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s40792-015-0081-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40792-015-0081-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40792-015-0081-x\"}],\"title\":\"Total

        pH has been suggested as one of the most important factors affecting the ecological
        characteristics of soil ammonia-oxidizers (AO), which mediate the conversion
        of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite and contribute significantly to the leaching
        of nitrate to groundwater and the production of atmospheric nitrous oxide
        (N_2O). However, the dynamics of the AO community in acidic purple soils,
        which are widely distributed in Southwest China, remain largely unknown. In
        this study, two typical purple soils with different pH values (acidic: ACI;
        alkaline: ALK) were collected and studied. The abundance of amoA (gene encoding
        ammonia monooxygenase) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA)
        and that of the cbbL gene (encoding ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase)
        were determined by real-time PCR, and the community structures of AOB and
        AOA were investigated by cloning and sequencing. The results revealed that
        abundances of AOB and AOA were significantly lower in the ACI purple soil
        sample than in the ALK sample, but a higher ratio of AOA to AOB was found
        in the ACI purple soil sample. No significant difference in the abundance
        of cbbL was found between the two soils, but the ratio of AOB and AOA amoA
        to cbbL genes in the ACI soil samples was higher than that in the ALK sample.
        Moreover, the ALK and ACI soils harbored contrasting community compositions
        of AO. AOB in the ALK were dominated by cluster 3a (87\_%), while the percentage
        of cluster 3a decreased and clusters 9 and 10 accounted for almost 77\_% of
        the AOB community in the ACI soil. Nitrososphaera and Nitrosotalea were the
        major AOA phylotypes in the ALK and ACI soils, respectively. In conclusion,
        our results revealed the potential relations among pH, AO, and total chemoautotrophic

        messageThe pine shoot beetle , Tomicus piniperda , is a potential vector of
        the pitch canker disease pathogen. The insect could transmit the pathogenic
        fungus during its maturation or regeneration feeding on the shoots of healthy
        pine crowns .ContextFusarium circinatum , the causal agent of pitch canker
        disease, currently affects Pinus radiata in northern Spain, causing pitch-soaked
        cankers and tree death. Although several species of the family Scolytinae
        have been reported as vectors of this pathogen, the role of the pine shoot
        beetle T. piniperda remains unclear.AimsThe general objective of this study
        was to determine whether T. piniperda is a vector for the pitch canker pathogen
        F. circinatum . For this purpose, Leach\u2019s postulates (1) an association
        between T. piniperda and trees affected by pitch canker disease; (2) regular
        visits by T. piniperda to healthy P. radiata trees; (3) presence of the pathogen
        on the insect in nature; and (4) transmission of the pathogen to disease-free
        host material under controlled conditions.MethodsFresh green shoots with feeding
        galleries were collected from the ground, breeding galleries were collected
        from diseased trunks and insects were collected during their dispersion flights.
        A laboratory experiment was conducted in which specimens of T. piniperda were
        inoculated with the pathogen prior to feeding on shoots.ResultsIn the field,
        T. piniperda was found to be associated with both diseased and healthy P.
        radiata trees, and F. circinatum was found to be present, at low rates, on
        the exoskeleton of T. piniperda . In the laboratory experiment, evidence of
        the ability of T. piniperda to transfer the pathogen to healthy shoots was
        found.ConclusionsThe study findings indicate T. piniperda as a plausible vector
        of this pathogen. We postulate for the first time a potential relationship
        between the life cycles of T. piniperda and F. circinatum .\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10552-015-0659-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10552-015-0659-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10552-015-0659-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-015-0659-4\"}],\"title\":\"A

        and therapeutic algorithms of acute, recurring, and chronic lower back pain
        in Germany will be particularly addressed. The importance of the physiologic-organic,
        the cognitive-emotional, the behavioral, and the social level to diagnostics

        and address its epidemiology, clinical importance, and significance for the
        health care system. This article will list some reasons why the musculoskeletal
        system in particular is frequently the site of chronic pain. The authors believe
        that these reasons are to be sought in the complex structures of the musculoskeletal
        system; in the particular sensitivity of the deep somatic nociceptive system

        Ad hoc Network (VANET) is a type of mobile ad hoc network based on short range

        models have been presented for pressures distribution in the contact interface
        of a soft finger and object in the literature. These models have been proposed
        without considering the effect of the tangential forces which are usually
        exerted in the contact interface of a soft finger and object during grasping
        and manipulation. Having an accurate pressures distribution model across the
        contact interface is important for designing tactile sensors and improving
        the modeling of the friction limit surface (LS). In this paper, a new and
        more accurate model is proposed to describe the asymmetry of the pressure
        distribution in the contact interface of a hemispherical soft finger under
        both normal and tangential forces. This model is derived based upon observations
        in the previous literature stating that the contact interface would move and
        skew toward the direction of the tangential force. According to the proposed
        pressure distribution model in this study, an improved and more accurate LS
        is presented. The LS profile obtained by this model is compared with the corresponding
        results based on the previous models. The new results show that the consideration
        of the skewness or asymmetry in the pressure distribution (due to the tangential
        force) causes the LS profile to shrink compared with that constructed with
        symmetric pressure distribution assumption. This shrinkage, as a result of
        the skewness and asymmetry of the pressure distribution, makes the contact
        interface more vulnerable. Furthermore, this new model can also provide a
        more accurate tool for the analysis of grasping and manipulation involving

        performing an aortotomy, there are a variety of techniques utilized for suture
        closure. There is no published data comparing the efficacy of various suture
        techniques. The goal of this study is to provide an ex-vivo quantitative assessment
        of resistance to leakage and dehiscence for three aortotomy closure techniques.Materials
        and methodsAn ex-vivo model was developed utilizing explanted porcine aorta.
        Aortotomies were closed using one of three techniques: 1) single layer baseball
        stitch 2) double layer baseball stitch 3) horizontal mattress stitch with
        a top layer baseball stitch. The aorta was pressurized with saline using an
        apparatus which captured all leaked fluid. The intra-aortic pressure was adjusted
        over 8 increments from 110 to 375\_mmHg. Leakage rates were determined at
        each pressure level. Ten aortotomies were performed for each technique, resulting
        in 240 calculated leakage rates.ResultsAt all pressures, the horizontal mattress
        group was measured to have significantly less leakage when compared to single
        or double layer baseball stitch closures ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.005). There
        was a trend towards a lower leakage rate in the double layer baseball compared
        to the single layer baseball stitch. However, this difference is statistically
        significant only at 300 and 335\_mmHg. There were no instances of rupture.ConclusionThis
        study provides the first quantitative comparison of three commonly used aortotomy
        closure techniques. The running horizontal mattress stitch combined with a
        baseball stitch provides the greatest resistance to leakage at all pressures.
        This technique may be superior in clinical scenarios with challenging hemostasis.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11524-015-9979-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11524-015-9979-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11524-015-9979-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11524-015-9979-7\"}],\"title\":\"The

        improvements such as pedestrian crosswalks that calm traffic and increase
        access to physical activity opportunities could alleviate important barriers

        The purpose of this study was to explore how the built environment influences
        street-crossing behaviors and traffic speeds in a low-income neighborhood
        with barriers to active living in Columbia, Missouri. In 2013, a signalized
        pedestrian crosswalk and 400-ft-long median was constructed along a busy 5-lane,
        high-speed arterial highway linking low-income housing with a park and downtown
        areas. Data collection occurred prior to June 2012, and after June 2013, completion
        of the project at the intervention site and control site. Direct observation
        of street-crossing behaviors was performed at designated intersections/crosswalks
        or non-designated crossing points. Traffic volume and speed were captured
        using embedded magnetic traffic detectors. At the intervention site, designated
        crossings increased at the new crosswalk ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.001), but
        not at non-designated crossings ( p \u2009=\u20090.52) or designated crossings
        at intersections ( p \u2009=\u20090.41). At the control site, there was no
        change in designated crossings ( p \u2009=\u20090.94) or non-designated crossings
        ( p \u2009=\u20090.79). Motor vehicles traveling above the speed limit of
        35\_mph decreased from 62,056 (46\_%) to 46,256 (35\_%) ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.001)

        the types and frequencies of clinical complications experienced when using
        a modified lingual Herbst appliance and to compare these with those associated

        records for 35 consecutive subjects treated during the observation period
        from October 2013 to August 2014 who received a combination of a lingual appliance
        and a modified Herbst appliance (WIN, DW LingualSystems) were assessed for
        complications linked to Herbst treatment phase. Complications were analyzed
        descriptively, and complication-free intervals were calculated using Kaplan-Meier
        plots. To enable a comparison with data reported in the literature, the cumulative
        treatment time for all subjects was divided by the total number of complications.Results71.4\_%
        of Herbst treatments were free from complications ( n \u2009=\u200925). Complications
        were seen on 13 occasions (8 instances of Herbst attachment loosening, 5\_L-Pin
        fractures). Most of these complications could be fixed chair side utilizing
        simple clinical measures. Considering all complications as identical statistical
        events, the percentage of treatments free from complications would be 88\_%
        for 100\_days, 70\_% for 200\_days and 56.8\_% for 300\_days. For severe complications,
        the averaged complication-free treatment interval was found to be 27.8\_months.ConclusionIn
        terms of clinical sturdiness, and taking into consideration the step-wise
        mode of activation used here as well as the differences in the design of the

        belonging to the preceding generation of customized lingual systems. Success
        in treatment of non-compliant Angle\_Class II correction is considered to

        key aspect of cooperation is partner choice: choosing the best available partner
        improves the chances of a successful cooperative interaction and decreases
        the likelihood of being exploited. However, in studies on cooperation subjects
        are rarely allowed to freely choose their partners. Group-living animals live
        in a complex social environment where they can choose among several social
        partners differing in, for example, sex, age, temperament, or dominance status.
        Our study investigated whether wild Barbary macaques succeed to cooperate
        using an experimental apparatus, and whether individual and social factors
        affect their choice of partners and the degree of cooperation. We used the
        string pulling task that requires two monkeys to manipulate simultaneously
        a rope in order to receive a food reward. The monkeys were free to interact
        with the apparatus or not and to choose their partner. The results showed
        that Barbary macaques are able to pair up with a partner to cooperate using
        the apparatus. High level of tolerance between monkeys was necessary for the
        initiation of successful cooperation, while strong social bond positively
        affected the maintenance of cooperative interactions. Dominance status, sex,
        age, and temperament of the subjects also affected their choice and performance.
        These factors thus need to be taken into account in cooperative experiment
        on animals. Tolerance between social partners is likely to be a prerequisite
        for the evolution of cooperation.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11669-015-0405-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11669-015-0405-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11669-015-0405-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11669-015-0405-3\"}],\"title\":\"Phase

        and urbanization increase environmental degradation while financial development
        has no effect on it, and trade leads to environmental improvements. In addition,
        this study does not support the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve

        while GDP^2 increases the levels of gas emissions. The results from the Granger

        and GDP and trade openness while no causality is determined between CO_2 and

        the past decade, the issue of s tandardization in the microfluidics arena
        has been brought up several times, but its exact role remains largely unclear.
        A recent initiative has been launched to identify items that are in need of
        standardization. This paper represents the outputs from discussions with industrial
        and academic experts and results from an online survey. The results show the
        need to address standard interconnects and to develop a classification system
        for microfluidic devices. Here, we propose to standardize pitch spacing dimension
        that will enable complex high-density world-to-chip microfluidic interconnections.
        We also present a first attempt to classify existing microfluidic devices.
        It is envisaged that a system of classification will be pivotal in the development
        of standard documents, which details testing guidelines for the purpose of
        reliability assessment of microfluidic devices. The proposed standards to
        be developed are currently being supported by several industrial organizations
        and have the advantage that they do not depend on proprietary interests relating
        to any organization.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11249-015-0579-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11249-015-0579-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11249-015-0579-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11249-015-0579-1\"}],\"title\":\"Tribological

        the influence of hBN mass fraction and test load on the tribological performance.
        The morphology features of friction surfaces were observed with scanning electron

        content of 0, 10\_% weight ratio, named as BN00, BN10) ceramic composites
        coupled with GCI were reached up to 0.5. However, as hBN contents reach to
        20 and 30\_% (BN20, BN30), the friction coefficient was reduced to 0.2. The
        tribological mechanism of GCI-BN00 couple is mainly based on adhesive wear
        with severe plastic deformation of GCI disk. On the contrary, a continuous
        surface film is promoted on the worn-surface BN30. Thus, the main tribological
        morphology of the coupled gray cast iron shows slight micro-cuttings. With
        an increase in the test load, the wear mechanism of GCI-BN00 and GCI-BN10
        is still adhesive wear with similar friction coefficients compared to 5\_N
        load. However, as test load increases, the film formed on BN30 worn surface
        is damaged, resulting in the rise of the friction coefficient. The friction
        coefficient increases to 0.6 at the load of 10\_N, indicating that the addition
        of hBN has no improvement on lubrication in this load regime.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12649-015-9429-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12649-015-9429-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12649-015-9429-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-015-9429-5\"}],\"title\":\"Characterization

        desulfurization waste slag from hot metal pretreatment process is a typical
        solid waste generated in the integrated steel company. About 7- to 9-kg waste
        slag is produced per ton hot metal treated in the Kanbara Reactor (KR) desulfurization
        process, and the waste slag contains approximately 40\u201360\_% CaO and large
        amounts of iron. Therefore, effectively valorization of these waste slags
        is significant for resources reutilization and environmental protection. A
        novel valorization process of KR desulfurization waste slag into iron-containing
        substances and desulfurization agent for hot metal pretreatment was investigated.
        Magnetic separation method was conducted to recovery iron-containing substances
        from the KR waste slag. Various techniques such as XRD, TG-DSC, SEM\u2013EDS
        were used to characterize the non-magnetic (NM) waste slag. The pyrometallurgical
        recycling experiments of NM waste slag were performed in a tube furnace after
        considering various parameters, such as reaction temperature, ratio of slag
        volume and slag composition. The results show that ~56\_wt% of the KR slag
        can potentially be recycled as an iron-bearing raw material for steelmaking
        process. The major components of NM KR waste slag are calcium, silicon and
        iron oxides, and ~70\_vol% of NM waste slag particles are \\u003c100\_\u03BCm.
        The major crystalline phases present in NM waste slag are C, Ca (OH)_2, CaSO_4,
        CaF_2, CaCO_3, CaS and Ca_2SiO_4. A mass loss of ~20\_wt% from room temperature
        to 1573\_K is possibly due to the vaporization of moisture, water of crystallization
        and fluoride, decomposition of carbonates and CaSO_4. The desulfurization
        ratio in pig iron increases with reaction time, which indicates that the NM
        waste slag still has desulfurization ability. Moreover, the desulfurization
        ratio increases with temperature and ratio of slag volume. It is also found
        that the apparent desulfurization rate constants are in the range between
        0.007 and 0.016\_min^\u22121.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00769-015-1175-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00769-015-1175-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00769-015-1175-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00769-015-1175-7\"}],\"title\":\"F.

        on acclimatization and hardening. At the hardening phase, there was an enhancement
        of various growth parameters of plants treated with microbial culture supernatants
        from the first week onwards. Interestingly, after a period of 5\_wk, the biohardened
        plants showed significant improvement in number of roots, length of roots,
        number of root branches, length of shoot, number of leaves, leaf length, and
        leaf width. Most remarkably, microbial treatments shortened the hardening

        of strategic structural changes to its health system, catalyzed through international

        universal coverage of ART at a CD4 cell count of 200 cells/mm^3 in 2007 and
        increased the threshold for initiation of ART to \u2264350 cells/mm^3 in 2008.
        Further, 2013 guidelines raised the threshold for initiation to \u2264500

        female participation in ultra-endurance events may place them at risk for

        knowledge, occurrence of disordered eating and triad risk amongst participants
        of the 2014 89-km Comrades Marathon event.MethodsA survey utilising the Low
        Energy Availability in Females questionnaire (LEAF-Q) and Female Athlete Screening
        Tool (FAST) questionnaire was conducted on female participants in order to
        determine the risk. In addition, seven questions pertaining to the triad were
        asked in order to determine the athlete\u2019s knowledge of the triad. Athletes
        were requested to complete the anonymous questionnaire after written informed
        consent was obtained while waiting in the event registration queues. Statistical
        analyses included Pearson product\u2013moment correlations, chi-square tests
        and cross-tabulations to evaluate associations of interest.ResultsKnowledge
        of the triad was poor with 92.5\_% of participants having not heard of the
        triad before and most of those who had, gained their knowledge from school
        or university. Only three athletes were able to name all 3 components of the
        triad. Amenorrhoea was the most commonly recalled component while five participants
        were able to name the component of low bone mineral density. Of the 306 athletes
        included in the study, 44.1\_% were found to be at risk for the female athlete
        triad. One-third of participants demonstrated disordered eating behaviours
        with nearly half reporting restrictive eating behaviours. There is a significant
        association between athletes at risk for the triad according to the LEAF-Q

        More athletes in the groups with clinical and sub-clinical eating disorders

        44.1\_% being at a high risk for the triad. Therefore, education and regular
        screening programmes targeting these athletes are overdue. Postmenopausal
        athletes are at particularly high risk for large losses in bone mass if they
        experience chronic energy deficiency and hence require special focus.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s12891-015-0707-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s12891-015-0707-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s12891-015-0707-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12891-015-0707-y\"}],\"title\":\"Intraindividual

        peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several
        autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association
        of DPP-IV presence in blood plasma and mononuclear cells with the disease
        activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).MethodsPatients with active RA ( n \u2009=\u200927)
        were examined at the study enrolment and a follow-up examination was performed
        after the regression of the joint effusions and at least 6\_months after the
        first investigation. The control group comprised patients with a noninflammatory
        joint disease, i.e. osteoarthritis (OA; n \u2009=\u200915). The DPP-IV-like
        enzymatic activity was measured by a kinetic fluorimetric method, the concentration
        of DPP-IV in the blood plasma was determined using ELISA and the expression
        of DPP-IV in leukocytes was assayed by flow cytometry.ResultsBlood plasma
        DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity (median\u2009\xB1\u2009SD 220.15\u2009\xB1\u200983.6
        pkat/mL in RA vs. 376.9\u2009\xB1\u2009144.9 pkat/mL in OA, p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.001)
        and concentrations (median\u2009\xB1\u2009SD 465.1\u2009\xB1\u2009215.6\_ng/mL
        in RA vs. 953.3\u2009\xB1\u2009368.4\_ng/mL in OA, p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.001)
        were lower in patients with active RA compared to OA. In RA patients, the
        blood plasma DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity negatively correlated with the
        CRP concentration ( r \u2009=\u2009\u22120.39, p \u2009=\u20090.044). No significant
        differences were observed in the DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity and DPP-IV
        expression in blood mononuclear cells between the RA and OA groups. At follow-up,
        18 RA patients had a less active disease as demonstrated by an improved DAS28
        score. In this group, comparison of the entry and the follow-up values in
        individual patients revealed an increase of the blood plasma DPP-IV-like enzymatic
        activity (median\u2009\xB1\u2009SD 141\u2009\xB1\u200946\_% of the patient\u2019s
        entry values, p \u2009=\u20090.011) and DPP-IV concentration (median\u2009\xB1\u2009SD
        168\u2009\xB1\u200925\_%, of the patient\u2019s entry values, p \u2009=\u20090.033).
        In contrast to the blood plasma, the DPP-IV expression in blood mononuclear
        cells was reduced in these patients as evidenced by a decrease in the cell
        surface DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity as well as the median fluorescence
        intensity of DPP-IV staining in lymphocytes (median\u2009\xB1\u2009SD 66\u2009\xB1\u200956\_%,
        p \u2009=\u20090.018 and 63\u2009\xB1\u200931\_% of the patient\u2019s entry
        values, p \u2009=\u20090.005, respectively).ConclusionsThe association between
        RA activity and the changes in blood plasma and blood mononuclear cell DPP-IV
        in individual patients supports the possible relationship of DPP-IV to RA

        number of offences with animals as a \u201Cweapon\u201D or as victims is steadily
        increasing; therefore, the establishment of molecular genetic animal-specific
        assays is recommended and one goal was to develop a simple genetic testing
        system for species determination. In addition to forensic genetic tests, biostatistical
        methods must be developed and validated. This article presents a case where
        a dog was beaten to death. Employing preliminary tests for blood determination,
        a self-designed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis,
        short tandem repeat (STR) typing and subsequent biostatistical calculations
        using a self-developed software program, the identity of the dead dog could
        be proven and the animal could be linked to the potential weapon leading to
        the conviction of the offender.ZusammenfassungDie Zahl der Straftaten mit

        of ovarian cancer, (4) 26 follow-up women with recurrent ovarian cancer, and
        (5) 32 follow-up women with stable ovarian cancer. The 25-OH vitamin D was
        quantified with LUMIPULSE\xAE G 25-OH vitamin D on LUMIPULSE\xAE G 1200 (Fujirebio,
        Japan). As a threshold value, identified by ROC curve analysis, 20.2\_ng/mL
        (sensitivity 73.3\_%, specificity 84\_%) was chosen corresponding to the limit
        between sufficient and insufficient 25-OH vitamin D according to the WHO.
        Low 25-OH vitamin D levels were observed in 26\_% of women without gynecologic
        diseases, in 80\_% of women with recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer and in
        24\_% women affected by benign ovarian diseases ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.001).
        The follow-up study showed an insufficient level of 25-OH vitamin D in 73\_%

        with benign ovarian diseases. The women with recurrent ovarian cancer presented
        more often low levels compared to women with stable ovarian cancer. This study

        headwater fens at high elevations exist in the dry climatic regime of western
        Colorado, despite increasing demands for water development since the 1800\u2019s.
        Fens on Grand Mesa have accumulated plant material as peat for thousands of
        years due to cold temperatures and consistently saturated soils. The peatlands
        maintain unique plant communities, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and carbon
        storage. We located and differentiated 88 fens from 15 wet meadows and 2 marshes
        on Grand Mesa. Field work included determining vegetation, soils, moisture
        regimes, and impacts from human activities. All fens were groundwater-supported
        systems that occurred in depressions and slopes within sedimentary landslide
        and volcanic glacial till landscapes. Fens occupied 400\_ha or less than 1\_%
        of the 46,845\_ha research area and ranged in size from 1 to 46\_ha. Peat
        water pH in undisturbed sites ranged from 4.3 to 7.1. Most fens had plant
        communities dominated by sedges ( Carex ) with an understory of brown mosses.
        Variation in vegetation was controlled by stand wetness, water table level,
        organic C, conductivity (EC), and temperature \xB0C. Fen soils ranged from
        13.6 to 44.1\_% organic C with a mean of 30.3\_%. Species diversity in fens
        was restricted by cold short growing seasons, stressful anaerobic conditions,
        and disturbance. Multivariate analysis was used to analyze relationships between
        vegetation, environmental, and impact variables. Stand wetness, water table
        level, OC, electrical conductivity (EC), and temperature were used to analyze
        vegetation variance in undisturbed fens, wet meadows, and marshes. Vegetation
        composition in impacted fens was influenced by flooding, sedimentation, stand
        wetness, water table level, OC, EC, and temperature. Hydrologically modified
        fens supported 58 plant species compared to 101 species in undisturbed fens.
        Analysis of historical 1936\u20132007 aerial photographs and condition scalars
        helped quantify impacts of human activities in fens as well as vegetation
        changes. Fourteen fens had evidence of peat subsidence, from organic soil
        collapse, blocks of peat in the margins, soil instability, and differences
        in surface peat height between the fen soil surface and the annually flooded
        soil surface. Of 374\_ha of fens in the Grand Mesa study area, 294\_ha (79\_%)
        have been impacted by human activities such as ditching, drainage, flooding,

        forecasting of evaporative loss ( E ) is vital for water resource management
        and understanding of hydrological process for farming practices, ecosystem
        management and hydrologic engineering. This study has developed three machine
        learning algorithms, namely the relevance vector machine (RVM), extreme learning
        machine (ELM) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) for the prediction
        of E using five predictor variables, incident solar radiation ( S ), maximum
        temperature ( T _max), minimum temperature ( T _min), atmospheric vapor pressure
        ( VP ) and precipitation ( P ). The RVM model is based on the Bayesian formulation
        of a linear model with appropriate prior that results in sparse representations.
        The ELM model is computationally efficient algorithm based on Single Layer
        Feedforward Neural Network with hidden neurons that randomly choose input
        weights and the MARS model is built on flexible regression algorithm that
        generally divides solution space into intervals of predictor variables and
        fits splines (basis functions) to each interval. By utilizing random sampling
        process, the predictor data were partitioned into the training phase (70\_%
        of data) and testing phase (remainder 30\_%). The equations for the prediction
        of monthly E were formulated. The RVM model was devised using the radial basis
        function, while the ELM model comprised of 5 inputs and 10 hidden neurons
        and used the radial basis activation function, and the MARS model utilized
        15 basis functions. The decomposition of variance among the predictor dataset
        of the MARS model yielded the largest magnitude of the Generalized Cross Validation
        statistic (\u22480.03) when the T _max was used as an input, followed by the
        relatively lower value (\u22480.028, 0.019) for inputs defined by the S and
        VP . This confirmed that the prediction of E utilized the largest contributions
        of the predictive features from the T _max, verified emphatically by sensitivity
        analysis test. The model performance statistics yielded correlation coefficients
        of 0.979 (RVM), 0.977 (ELM) and 0.974 (MARS), Root-Mean-Square-Errors of 9.306,
        9.714 and 10.457 and Mean-Absolute-Error of 0.034, 0.035 and 0.038. Despite
        the small differences in the overall prediction skill, the RVM model appeared
        to be more accurate in prediction of E . It is therefore advocated that the
        RVM model can be employed as a promising machine learning tool for the prediction
        of evaporative loss.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11425-015-5051-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11425-015-5051-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11425-015-5051-z\"}],\"title\":\"Norm

        forests are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities often resulting
        in habitat and biodiversity loss. To effectively manage and protect these
        areas, it is important to have an understanding of the factors affecting their
        biodiversity. Previous research has shown that birds in tropical regions are
        severely affected by human-induced habitat conversion and disturbance. The
        effects, however, are often area and guild-specific and the underlying mechanisms
        are frequently unclear. In this study, we disentangle and quantify the direct
        and indirect effects of human population density, distance to forest edge,
        habitat disturbance, and vegetation structure and composition on the total
        abundance and species richness of birds in Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Specifically,
        we use structural equation modeling to develop and test path models, which
        reflect the potential causal relationships between the bird assemblages and
        the chosen explanatory factors. Relationships were tested on the overall bird
        community and on five different guilds, classified according to birds\u2019
        forest specialization and feeding preferences (i.e. forest specialists, generalists
        and visitors, and frugivores and insectivores). Results showed that habitat
        disturbance, caused by logging, had a weak positive direct effect on the bird
        communities, but also had a strong detrimental indirect effect, particularly
        on the total abundance and species richness of forests specialists and insectivores.
        The negative effect was mediated through changes in the forest\u2019s vegetation
        structure and composition. Shorter distances to the forest edge also had a
        negative effect, on all bird categories except on forest visitors, which also
        benefited from higher levels of disturbance. Our study shows that although
        in some cases habitat disturbance may have no strong direct negative effects
        it can still negatively influence bird communities in an indirect way. In
        the case of Kakamega Forest, we suggest that to conserve bird communities
        it is important to maintain the forest\u2019s compositional and structural
        diversity by reducing human-induced habitat disturbance, such as illegal logging

        is a strong trend of declining populations in many species of both animals
        and plants. Dwindling numbers of species can eventually lead to their functional
        extinction. Functional, or ecological, extinction occurs when a species becomes
        too rare to fulfill its ecological, interactive role in the ecosystem, leading
        to true (numerical) extinction of other depending species. Recent theoretical
        work on food webs suggests that the frequency of functional extinction might
        be surprisingly high. However, little is known about the risk of functional
        species extinctions in networks with other types of interactions than trophic
        ones. Here, we explore the frequency of functional extinctions in model ecological
        networks having different proportions of antagonistic and mutualistic links.
        Furthermore, we investigate the topological relationship between functionally
        and numerically extinct species. We find that (1) the frequency of functional
        extinctions is higher in networks containing a mixture of antagonistic and
        mutualistic interactions than in networks with only one type of interaction,
        (2) increased mortality rate of species having both mutualistic and antagonistic
        links is more likely to lead to extinction of another species than to extinction
        of the species itself compared to species having only mutualistic or antagonistic
        links, and (3) trophic distance (shortest path) between functionally and numerically
        extinct species is, on average, longer than one, indicating the importance
        of indirect effects. These results generalize the findings of an earlier study
        on food webs, demonstrating the potential importance of functional extinction

        mean percentage of correct answers to questions objectively assessing understanding
        was 59\_% in patients, 78\_% in medical specialists, and 74\_% in other health

        in patients. For non-colored charts, 49.8\_% of patients did not have a preference.
        Colored bar charts (39\_%) were preferred over heat maps (20\_%) and colored

        of two-dimensional quantum field theories with factorizing S-matrices have
        been constructed by the operator-algebraic methods, by first showing the existence

        have been limited to the class of S-matrices whose components are analytic
        in rapidity in the physical strip. In this work, we construct candidates for

        sugar-reformulated products (commercially available foods and beverages that

        for lowering sugar intake at a population level. The impact of sugar-reformulated
        products on body weight, energy balance (EB) dynamics and cardiovascular disease
        risk indicators has yet to be established. The REFORMulated foods (REFORM)
        study examined the impact of an 8-week sugar-reformulated product exchange
        on body weight, EB dynamics, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, glycemia
        and lipemia.MethodsA randomized,\_controlled, double-blind, crossover dietary

        and women (age 32.0\_\xB1\_9.8\_year, BMI 23.5\_\xB1\_3.0\_kg/m^2) who were
        randomly assigned to consume either regular sugar or sugar-reduced foods and

        total sugars ( P \_\\u003c\_0.001) and non-milk extrinsic sugars ( P \_\\u003c\_0.001)

        repertoire of antibodies with high affinity and specificity for exposed antigens.
        The B cell receptor ( BCR B cell receptor (BCR) ) is a transmembrane antibody,
        which facilitates the clonal selection of B cells producing secreted antibodies
        of the same specificity. The diverse antibody repertoire is generated by V(D)J
        recombination of heavy and light chain genes, whereas affinity maturation
        is mediated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated mutagenesis.
        These processes, which are essential for the generation of adaptive humoral

        disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
        loss of memory and other cognitive functions. AD can be classified into familial
        AD (FAD) and sporadic AD (SAD) based on heritability and into early onset
        AD (EOAD) and late onset AD (LOAD) based on age of onset. LOAD cases are more
        prevalent with genetically complex architecture. In spite of significant research
        focused on understanding the etiological mechanisms, search for diagnostic
        biomarker(s) and disease-modifying therapy is still on. In this article, we

        including role of beta-amyloid and apolipoprotein E (APOE) along with promising
        newer etiological factors such as epigenetic modifications that have been
        associated with AD suggesting its multifactorial nature. As genomic studies

        carbon (DLC) coatings has the potential to greatly improve the wear resistance
        and friction of aluminum alloys, but practical application has so far been
        limited by poor adhesion due to large difference in hardness and elasticity
        between the two materials. This study investigates the deposition of DLC onto
        an Al-alloy using an intermediate AlN layer with a graded hardness to create
        a hybrid coating. By controlling the hardness of the AlN film, it was found
        that the wear life of the DLC film could be improved 80-fold compared to a
        DLC film deposited directly onto Al-alloy. Furthermore, it was demonstrated
        through finite element simulation that creating a hardness gradient in the
        AlN intermediate layer reduces the distribution of stress in the DLC film,
        while also increasing the force of adhesion between the DLC and AlN layers.
        Given that both the DLC and AlN films were deposited using the same unbalanced
        magnetron sputtering method, this process is considered to represent a simple
        and effective means of improving the wear resistance of Al-alloy components

        compared, using SEM, for analyzing fitness related eco-physiological traits

        between strains within species, between species and asymmetry in hybrids of
        two species have been calculated for understanding the demographic success
        of the two species. The present results revealed that variation of traits

        traits are not strongly constrained within species. The main findings show
        that following eco-physiological traits of eggshells are mostly diverged between
        two species: (i) dorsal appendages (DA) length, (ii) insertion position of

        identification on the basis of the highly conserved 16S rRNA ( rrs ) gene

        the actions of two employees who have no knowledge of one another, and therefore
        cannot be engaged in a joint intentional action. I argue that this shows that,
        contrary to what joint action theorists are committed to, every intentional
        collective action does not entail the existence of a joint intentional action.

        implants with a titanium post provide (1) better ingrowth with fewer radiolucencies,
        (2) better outcome and pain scores, and (3) lower risk of complications and
        revisions?MethodsBetween 2009 and 2010, 126 patients underwent primary total
        shoulder arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. Patients were included in this retrospective
        study if they consented for inclusion in a shoulder arthroplasty registry,
        had complete baseline and 2-year data, and had complete radiographs. Eighty-three
        (67%) were available at an average followup of 3.2 years (range, 24\u201345
        months). Forty received a conventional all-polyethylene pegged glenoid and

        there was one high-volume surgeon in each of the study groups. Radiographs
        were taken at the 2-year followup and analyzed for radiolucent lines. CT scans

        bites and erythema migrans, the most common early manifestation of Lyme borreliosis,
        have increased substantially in the Netherlands. The current article aims
        to estimate and validate the incidence of GP-reported Lyme carditis in the
        Netherlands.MethodsWe sent a questionnaire to all GPs in the Netherlands on
        clinical diagnoses of Lyme borreliosis in 2009 and 2010. To validate and adjust
        the obtained incidence rate, medical records of cases of Lyme carditis reported
        by GPs in this incidence survey were reviewed and categorised according to
        likelihood of the diagnosis of Lyme carditis.ResultsLyme carditis occurred
        in 0.2\u2009% of all patients with GP-reported Lyme borreliosis. The adjusted
        annual incidence was six GP-reported cases of Lyme carditis per 10\_million
        inhabitants, i.e. approximately ten cases per year in 2009 and 2010.ConclusionsWe
        report the first incidence estimate for Lyme carditis in the Netherlands,
        validated by a systematic review of the medical records. Although Lyme carditis
        is an uncommon manifestation of Lyme borreliosis, physicians need to be aware
        of this diagnosis, in particular in countries where the incidence of Lyme
        borreliosis has increased during the past decades.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10531-015-1002-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10531-015-1002-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10531-015-1002-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-015-1002-9\"}],\"title\":\"Managing

        large carnivores in human-inhabited areas is challenging as their large range
        requirements often brings them into conflict with people. Learning from an
        extraordinary historical example of large carnivore resilience in a human-occupied
        landscape, we detail the case of human-tiger interactions on a small (576\_km^2)
        island, Singapore. Newspaper reports archived in the National Library of Singapore
        were used to construct a data set for interactions that occurred from 1831\u20131930.
        During this period, there were a reported 156 tiger sightings, 211 fatal tiger
        attacks on people and 114 tiger captures, which were mainly in response to
        these attacks. The number of interactions peaked between 1846 and 1865 with
        6.8 people on average being killed annually. From 1910 onwards, there was
        a sharp decline in the number of tiger incidents, concluding with the last
        wild tiger being captured in 1930. Human-tiger interactions were widespread
        across Singapore, occurring in 24 of its 29 districts, but predominantly located
        in plantations and forests. This study also maps and describes the immense
        pressure placed on tigers in Singapore through the near complete conversion
        of their natural forest habitat to plantations and the frequent tiger killings.
        Our study offers insights to large carnivore management because under these
        prevailing conditions, tigers persisted in Singapore under intense persecution
        for almost 60\_years. Most likely, the Singapore\u2019s tigers were supplemented

        model based on a combination of lubrication theory and capillary effects (ignoring
        inertial effects and gravity) is developed to predict the shape and pressure
        drop of long bubbles flowing in circular tubes in pressure-driven flows. An
        analytical solution for the thickness of the wetting film left on the tube
        wall as a function of the Capillary number (the ratio between viscous effects
        and surface tension) was derived by Klaseboer et al. (Phys Fluids 26:032107,
        2014 ), which considerably extends the original result of Bretherton (J Fluid
        Mech 10:166\u2013188, 1961 ) and confirms the empirical law of Aussillous
        and Qu\xE9r\xE9 (Phys Fluids 12:2367\u20132371, 2000 ). It is based on a crucial
        condition that requires that the bubble must fit inside the tube. An extension
        of this formulation allows for an analytical expression of the pressure drop
        across the bubble by applying the tube fit condition for the front and the
        back of the bubble and a force balance. The complete shape of the bubble can
        then be obtained numerically by applying boundary conditions at the tube centre.
        The interesting physics occurring at the back of the bubble is also investigated.
        A theoretical condition for the minimal length of such a bubble is given.
        Comparisons with experimental and numerical data for the shape of the bubble,
        pressure drop and curvature at the front and rear of the bubble for small

        nomogram to predict disease-specific mortality (DSM) following surgery for
        soft tissue sarcoma (STS) has been developed by the Memorial Sloan Kettering
        Cancer Center (MSKCC). The goal of this study was to validate this nomogram
        by assessing discrimination and calibration at the population level using
        a national cancer database.MethodsRetrospective review of the Surveillance,
        Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries identified patients undergoing
        surgery for STS from 1988 to 2011. Data for patient age, tumor size, tumor
        grade, histologic subtype, sex, primary tumor location, and tumor depth were
        entered into the nomogram calculator for each patient. Discrimination was
        quantified using a concordance index. Calibration was assessed by comparing
        quintiles of nomogram-predicted probabilities of disease-specific mortality\_(DSM)
        with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage DSM.ResultsOverall, 9237
        patients were identified with complete information needed for the nomogram.
        With a mean follow-up of 45\_months, the concordance index for nomogram-predicted
        DSM with actual DSM was 0.74 for the entire cohort. For low- and high-grade

        with better predictive ability than AJCC staging. However, a concordance index
        of 0.74 suggests that further improvement in prognostication is needed, perhaps
        with biological markers or additional clinical variables.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10802-015-0077-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10802-015-0077-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10802-015-0077-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10802-015-0077-9\"}],\"title\":\"The

        It used data from the first four waves of the UK\u2019s Millennium Cohort
        Study, when children (50.3\_% male) were aged 9\_months, and 3, 5 and 7\_years.
        The sample was 8302 families where both biological parents were co-resident
        across the four waves. Father involvement (participation in play and physical
        and educational activities with the child) was measured at ages 3, 5 and 7,
        as was child problem behaviour (assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties
        Questionnaire). Key child and family covariates related to father involvement
        and child problem behaviour were controlled. Little evidence was found that
        more father involvement predicted less child problem behaviour two years later,
        with the exception of father involvement at child\u2019s age 5 having a significant,
        but small, effect on peer problems at age 7. There were two child effects.
        More hyperactive children at age 3 had more involved fathers at age 5, and
        children with more conduct problems at age 3 had more involved fathers at
        age 5. Child temperament did not moderate any child behaviour effects on father
        involvement. Thus, in young, intact UK families, child adjustment appears
        to predict, rather than be predicted by, father involvement in early childhood.
        When children showed more problematic behaviours, fathers did not become less
        involved. In fact, early hyperactivity and conduct problems in children seemed
        to elicit more involvement from fathers. At school age, father involvement

        consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled at the time of diagnosis.
        Eighteen (11 HL and seven aNHL) were considered for the analysis. They received
        chemo/radiotherapy as induction and completed post-treatment evaluation performing
        both ^18F-FDG PET/CT and WB-MR/DWIBS. The revised response criteria for malignant
        lymphomas were used to assess the response to treatment. We evaluated the
        agreement between the two methods by Cohen\u2019s K test. Post-therapy WB-MR/DWIBS
        sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy were then calculated, considering

        is one of the most common devastating disease affecting millions of people

        have been exploited by researchers to discover novel anti-cancer therapeutics
        with minimum or no side effects and plants have proved their usefulness in
        anti-cancer therapy in past few years. Ricin, a cytotoxic plant protein isolated
        from castor bean seeds, is a ribosome-inactivating protein which destroys
        the cells by inhibiting proteins synthesis. Ricin presents great potential
        as anti-cancer agent and exerts its anti-cancer activity by inducing apoptosis

        properties of plant toxin ricin, its potential applications in cancer therapy,
        challenges associated with its use as therapeutic agent and the recent advances
        made to overcome these challenges. Nanotechnology could open the doors for
        quick development of ricin-based anti-cancer therapeutics. Conceivably, ricin

        transpositions from the Departments of Odontology at the Universities of Copenhagen
        and Aarhus and by the Danish municipal orthodontic service. The cases were
        divided into three groups: unilateral transposition of the canine and first
        premolar (Type 1U), bilateral transposition of canine and first premolar (Type
        1B), and unilateral transposition of canine and lateral incisor (Type 2).
        The dentitions were analysed regarding agenesis and dental morphological anomalies
        on panoramic radiographs, and craniofacial aspects were cephalometrically
        analysed on profile images The results were statistically evaluated.ResultsAll
        groups demonstrated increased occurrences of agenesis (Type 1U and Type 1B:
        31 agenesis in 15 patients; and Type 2 three agenesis in three patients).
        Taurodontic root morphology was most dominant in Type 1U. Peg-shaped lateral
        incisors showed an increased occurrence, though not in Type 1U. Skeletally,

        of maxillary canines involve dental and skeletal deviations. Dental deviations
        were predominantly taurodontic root morphology and agenesis. Regarding skeletal
        deviations, bilateral transpositions of the canines and the first premolars
        are associated with skeletal changes. Unilateral transpositions are possibly
        a localised deviation with minor or no skeletal involvements. The results

        We provide complexity results and show that, given the locations of all facilities,

        cancer carries a poor prognosis and cannot be cured by currently available
        therapy. Chemotherapy designed to prolong survival and improve the quality
        of life (QOL) of patients is the mainstay of treatment. Standard regimens
        of FOLFOX/bevacizumab and CapeOX/bevacizumab can cause neurotoxicity, potentially
        disrupting treatment. The results of 3 phase II studies of combination therapy
        with S-1, irinotecan, and bevacizumab showed comparable efficacy to mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab
        and CapeOX/bevacizumab, without severe neurotoxicity. Therefore, the establishment
        and evaluation of S-1-containing irinotecan-based regimens for first-line
        treatment are expected to become more important.MethodsThe TRICOLORE trial
        is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled phase III study which
        aims to evaluate the non-inferiority of combination therapy with S-1/irinotecan/bevacizumab
        (a 3-week regimen [SIRB] or 4-week regimen [IRIS/bevacizumab]) to oxaliplatin-based
        standard treatment (mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab or CapeOX/bevacizumab) in patients

        Patients will be randomly assigned to either the control group (mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab
        or CapeOX/bevacizumab) or study group (SIRB or IRIS/bevacizumab). The target
        sample size is 450 patients. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival
        (PFS), and the secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), response rate
        (RR), time to treatment failure (TTF), relative dose intensity (RDI), the
        incidence and severity of adverse events, quality of life (QOL), quality-adjusted

        and displacements of the center of gravity (COG) based on the profiles of
        standard wave gait was investigated. The continuous and discontinuous motion

        will receive VIPP-V in combination with care-as-usual and 50 dyads will receive
        care-as-usual. Families with a child (1\u20135 years of age) with a visual

        in the study. Primary outcome measures are parental sensitivity and the quality
        of parent-child interaction. Secondary outcome measures are parental self-efficacy,
        and parenting stress. To assess feasibility of implementation of the intervention
        the experiences of early intervention workers with regard to using VIPP-V
        are assessed. Moderator variables are the child\u2019s developmental age,
        working alliance between parent and VIPP-V intervention worker and empathy
        of the VIPP-V intervention worker. Data will be collected approximately one
        week before the intervention starts (T1), one week (T2) and three months (T3)
        after the intervention. Parent-child dyads in the care-as-usual-only condition
        will be assessed at the same time points. Both intention-to-treat and completer

        benefits from VIPP-V, and compatibility with existing services for parents
        of children with a visual or visual-and-intellectual disability. The current

        craniopharyngiomas (aCPs) are complex epithelial neoplasms that arise from
        the progenitors of the pituitary gland. Although benign, these tumours can
        be locally aggressive invading vital neighbouring structures such as the hypothalamus,
        the cranial and optic nerves. Congenital forms of aCPs diagnosed during foetal
        development are very rare. The purpose of this article is to present with
        a histopathological and molecular characterisation of congenital craniopharyngioma.MethodsHere
        we report a case of in utero diagnosed aCP, detected at 21\_weeks of gestation
        by ultrasound, visualised by MRI at 22\_weeks and histologically diagnosed
        at 23\_weeks. We provide with histopathological characterisation of rare form
        of congenital aCPs.ResultsDetailed examination of the tumour reveals the classical
        histological hallmarks of aCPs with the presence of stellate reticulum, palisading
        epithelium, wet keratin and calcification deposits. The tumour demonstrated
        complete absence of all pituitary hormones and the absence of the neuroendocrine
        marker, synaptophysin. Immunohistochemistry against \u03B2-catenin revealed
        occasional cells with nuclear-\u03B2-catenin localisation and the presence
        of pituitary progenitors positive for SOX9 and SOX2. Targeted Sanger sequencing
        revealed no genetic variants in oncogenes CTNNB1 and BRAF , previously associated
        with CP.ConclusionsIn this article, we provide with in-depth molecular and
        histological characterisation of in utero aCP due to an unknown driving mutation
        that could represent a sub-cohort of congenital aCPs.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00015-015-0196-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00015-015-0196-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00015-015-0196-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00015-015-0196-x\"}],\"title\":\"Multiple

        field observations, cross-section area balancing techniques and kinematic
        forward modelling, we present new insights into the evolution of the Jura
        fold-and-thrust belt in the Chasseral area between Lake Biel and the Vallon
        de St-Imier, in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland. Our results show that the
        structures of the Chasseral area and the associated regional uplift can be
        explained by thin-skinned deformation of the Mesozoic cover, without the need
        to involve highs in the pre-Triassic basement or invoking detachment folding
        with thickening of anticlinal cores by flow of Triassic evaporites. According
        to our thin-skinned model, the overall structure of the Chasseral initiated
        as a large-scale fault-bend fold, with initial detachment of the Mesozoic
        cover and NNW-directed movement of material along a basal d\xE9collement in
        Middle Triassic evaporites and important displacement along an upper detachment
        in the Middle Jurassic Opalinus-Ton Formation. This upper detachment extends
        from the Seekette to the Vallon de St-Imier (at least 11\_km) and further
        to the north. Deformation above the upper detachment occurs to the north of
        the Chasseral area and steps back later to form a series of forward-stepping
        fault-propagation folds at the northern Chasseral mountainside, with associated
        thrusts that show a typical stair-step geometry due to low-angle breakthroughs.
        The Seekette anticline on the southern Chasseral mountainside formed due to
        a late back-stepping backthrust. A total displacement of 11.3\_km is inferred
        that considerably exceeds a displacement estimation of 5.1\_km deduced from
        shortening of the upper boundary of the Jurassic sequence. Forward modelling
        suggests that material was transported 6.2\_km along the Opalinus-Ton detachment
        resulting in complex deformation to the north of the Vallon de St-Imier because
        there, folds and thrusts formed above both, the upper detachment and the basal
        d\xE9collement and interacted together.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s11671-015-0990-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s11671-015-0990-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s11671-015-0990-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s11671-015-0990-4\"}],\"title\":\"Visible

        have shown promising clinical results in cancer patients carrying BRCA1/2

        by immunohistochemistry with further validation by western blotting.ResultsWe

        In serous ovarian tumors, comparing intratumoral PARP1 expression between

        Interventions using positive emotions to reduce racial bias have been found
        wanting, while other research shows that positive affect can sometimes exacerbate
        implicit prejudice. Nevertheless, loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has shown
        some promise as a method of reducing bias despite increasing a broad range
        of positive emotions. A randomised control trial ( n \_=\_69) showed that
        a short-term induction of LKM decreased automatic processing, increased controlled
        processing, and was sufficient to reduce implicit prejudice towards the target\u2019s
        racial group but not towards a group untargeted by the meditation. Furthermore,
        the reduction in bias was shown to be mediated by other-regarding positive
        emotions alongside increased control and decreased automaticity on the IAT.
        Non-other-regarding positive emotions conversely showed no correlation with
        bias. The study is the first to show that a short-term positive emotional
        induction can reduce racial prejudice, and aids the understanding of how positive

        plant biomass accumulation is facilitated by the photosynthetic capacity of

        development and to assess the timing and the degree of an inhibition of the
        belowground biomass generation. Sugar beet seedlings and the retarding effect
        of beet cyst nematodes (BCN) were used as a model system.MethodsThirty BCN
        infested plants and 30 non-infested plants were grown in three litre pots
        under greenhouse conditions. Top-view images of the plant leaf canopy were
        taken every two or three days. Leaf and beet biomass were measured at three
        different dates (32, 41 and 70\_days after sowing (das)) by harvesting the

        China, and the samples of wheat flour, soil, drinking water and blood, urine,
        and hair of children were collected from these residents. The selenium concentrations
        from all these sources were determined using atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry.
        The levels of T-2 toxin and DON contamination in the wheat flour samples were
        assayed using HPLC-MS/MS. The average selenium content in the soil, drinking
        water, and wheat flour samples from KBD areas were 26.93\u2009\xB1\u200910.06\_\u03BCg/kg,

        respectively. Among these, the selenium levels in the drinking water and wheat
        flour samples from the KBD endemic county were significantly lower than those
        from the non-KBD county. For the selenium nutrient status, only the hair selenium
        concentration of children from the KBD endemic county was significantly lower
        than that from the non-KBD county. The contents of T-2 toxin in all wheat

        The DON level of wheat flour samples from the children\u2019s households in
        the non-KBD county was significantly lower than that from the KBD endemic
        county. These results suggest that the lower selenium status in Guide County
        still remains. While the selenium nutritional status of the local children
        has improved to some extent, partly due to the introduction of food produce
        from nonlocal areas. DON contamination in the wheat flour may be involved
        in the fluctuating high prevalence rates of KBD in children in the KBD endemic

        aims to estimate a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) for the coastal subregion

        the vulnerability of 14 coastal talukas of the Krishna\u2013Godavari delta
        region. This CVI is calculated by using four geological and three physical
        parameters characterizing the vulnerability of the study coastal region, including
        regional slope, coastal elevation, geomorphology, significant wave height,
        mean tidal range and relative sea level using different conventional and remotely

        the most common treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
        is increasingly used by healthy individuals as a \u201Csmart drug\u201D to
        enhance cognitive abilities like attention. A key feature of (selective) attention
        is the ability to ignore irrelevant but salient information in the environment
        (distractors). Although crucial for cognitive performance, until now, it is
        not known how the use of methylphenidate affects resistance to attentional
        capture by distractors.ObjectivesThe present study aims to clarify how methylphenidate
        affects distractor suppression in healthy individuals.MethodsThe effect of
        methylphenidate (20\_mg) on distractor suppression was assessed in healthy
        subjects ( N \u2009=\u200920), in a within-subject double-blind placebo-controlled
        crossover design. We used a visuospatial attention task with target faces
        flanked by strong (faces) or weak distractors (scrambled faces).ResultsMethylphenidate
        increased accuracy on trials that required gender identification of target
        face stimuli (methylphenidate 88.9\u2009\xB1\u20091.4 [mean\u2009\xB1\u2009SEM],
        placebo 86.0\u2009\xB1\u20091.2\_%; p \u2009=\u2009.003), suggesting increased
        processing of the faces. At the same time, however, methylphenidate increased
        reaction time when the target face was flanked by a face distractor relative
        to a scrambled face distractor (methylphenidate 34.9\u2009\xB1\u20093.73,
        placebo 26.7\u2009\xB1\u20092.84\_ms; p \u2009=\u2009.027), suggesting enhanced
        attentional capture by distractors with task-relevant features.ConclusionsWe
        conclude that methylphenidate amplifies salience of task-relevant information
        at the level of the stimulus category. This leads to enhanced processing of
        the target (faces) but also increased attentional capture by distractors drawn
        from the same category as the target.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10563-015-9198-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10563-015-9198-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10563-015-9198-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10563-015-9198-y\"}],\"title\":\"Macroporous

        The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of pure and doped samples confirms the

        processing of event streams evolved to an important class of data management
        over the last years and will become even more important due to novel applications
        such as the Internet of Things. Because systems for data stream and event
        processing have been developed independent of each other, often in competition
        and without the existence of any standards, the Stream Processing System (SPS)
        landscape is extremely heterogeneous today. To overcome the problems caused
        by this heterogeneity, a novel event processing middleware, the Java Event
        Processing Connectivity (JEPC), has been presented recently. However, despite
        the fact that SPSs can be accessed uniformly using JEPC, their different performance
        profiles caused by different algorithms and implementations remain. This gives
        the opportunity to query optimization, because individual system strengths
        can be exploited. In this paper, we present a novel query optimizer that exploits
        the technical heterogeneity in a federation of different unified SPSs. Taking
        into account different performance profiles of SPSs, we address query plan
        partitioning, candidate selection, and reducing inter-system communication
        in order to improve the overall query performance. We suggest a heuristic
        that finds a good initial mapping of sub-plans to a set of heterogenous SPSs.
        An experimental evaluation clearly shows that heterogeneous federations outperform
        homogeneous federations, in general, and that our heuristic performs well

        are highly dynamic structures that control the spatiotemporal pattern of cell
        growth and division. Microtubule dynamics are regulated by reversible protein
        phosphorylation involving both protein kinases and phosphatases. Never in
        mitosis A (NIMA)-related kinases (NEKs) are a family of serine/threonine kinases
        that regulate microtubule-related mitotic events in fungi and animal cells
        (e.g. centrosome separation and spindle formation). Although plants contain
        multiple members of the NEK family, their functions remain elusive. Recent
        studies revealed that NEK6 of Arabidopsis thaliana regulates cell expansion

        In addition, plant NEK members participate in organ development and stress
        responses. The present phylogenetic analysis indicates that plant NEK genes
        are diverged from a single NEK6 -like gene, which may share a common ancestor
        with other kinases involved in the control of microtubule organization. On
        the contrary, another mitotic kinase, polo-like kinase, might have been lost

        conclusionThe T-DNA 6b oncogene induces complex and partly unprecedented phenotypic
        changes in tobacco stems and leaves, which result from hypertrophy and hyperplasia
        with ectopic spot-like, ridge-like and sheet-like meristems. The Agrobacterium
        T-DNA oncogene 6b causes complex growth changes in tobacco including enations;
        this unusual phenotype has been called \u201C 6b enation syndrome\u201D. A
        detailed morphological and anatomical analysis of the aerial part of Nicotiana
        tabacum plants transformed with a dexamethasone-inducible dex-T- 6b gene revealed
        several striking growth phenomena. Among these were: uniform growth of ectopic
        photosynthetic cells on the abaxial leaf side, gutter-like petioles with multiple
        parallel secondary veins, ectopic leaf primordia emerging behind large glandular
        trichomes, corniculate structures emerging from distal ends of secondary veins,
        pin-like structures with remarkable branching patterns, ectopic vascular strands
        in midveins and petioles extending down along the stem, epiascidia and hypoascidia,
        double enations and complete inhibition of leaf outgrowth. Ectopic stipule-like
        leaves and inverted leaves were found at the base of the petioles. Epinastic
        and hyponastic growth of petioles and midveins yielded complex but predictable
        leaf folding patterns. Detailed anatomical analysis of over sixty different
        6b -induced morphological changes showed that the different modifications
        are derived from hypertrophy and abaxial hyperplasia, with ectopic photosynthetic
        cells forming spot-like, ridge-like and sheet-like meristems and ectopic vascular
        strands forming regular patterns in midveins, petioles and stems. Part of
        the enation syndrome is due to an unknown phloem-mobile enation factor. Graft
        experiments showed that the 6b mRNA is mobile and could be the enation factor.
        Our work provides a better insight in the basic effects of the 6b oncogene.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10854-015-3769-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10854-015-3769-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10854-015-3769-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10854-015-3769-6\"}],\"title\":\"New

        is a disabling symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) that involves failure
        to initiate and continue motor activity appropriately. PD disrupts fronto-basal

        to the hypothesis that freezing of gait may involve fundamental changes in
        both initiation and inhibition of motor actions. We asked whether PD patients
        who show freezing of gait show selective deficits in their ability to inhibit
        upper and lower extremity reactions. We compared older healthy controls, older
        PD controls without freezing of gait, and older PD participants with freezing
        of gait, in stop-signal tasks that measured the initiation (go trials) and
        inhibition (stop trials) of both hand and foot responses. When only go trials
        were presented, all three groups showed similar initiation speeds across lower
        and upper extremity responses. When stop-signal trials were introduced, both
        PD groups slowed their reactions nearly twice as much as healthy controls.
        While this adjustment helped PD controls stop their actions as quickly as
        healthy controls, PD patients with freezing showed significantly delayed inhibitory
        control of both upper and lower extremities. When anticipating the need to
        stop their actions urgently, PD patients show greater adjustments (i.e., slowing)
        to reaction speed than healthy controls. Despite these proactive adjustments,
        PD patients who freeze show marked impairments in inhibiting both upper and
        lower extremity responses, suggesting that freezing may involve a fundamental
        disruption to the brain\u2019s inhibitory control system.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00138-015-0709-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00138-015-0709-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00138-015-0709-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00138-015-0709-7\"}],\"title\":\"Discriminant

        margin criterion (MMC) is a promising feature extraction method proposed recently
        to enhance the well-known linear discriminant analysis. However, due to the
        maximization of L2-norm-based distances between different classes, the features
        extracted by MMC are not robust enough in the sense that in the case of multi-class,
        the faraway class pair may skew the solution from the desired one, thus leading
        the nearby class pair to overlap. Aiming at addressing this problem to enhance
        the performance of MMC, in this paper, we present a novel algorithm called
        complete robust maximum margin criterion (CRMMC) which includes three key
        components. To deemphasize the impact of faraway class pair, we maximize the
        L1-norm-based distance between different classes. To eliminate possible correlations
        between features, we incorporate an orthonormality constraint into CRMMC.
        To fully exploit discriminant information contained in the whole feature space,
        we decompose CRMMC into two orthogonal complementary subspaces, from which
        the discriminant features are extracted. In such a way, CRMMC can iteratively
        extract features by solving two related constrained optimization problems.
        To solve the resulting mathematical models, we further develop an effective
        algorithm by properly combining polarity function and optimal projected gradient

        knowledge has become more closely tied to economic development, the interrelationship

        comprehensive research review carried out on behalf of the Norwegian Ministry
        of Education in 2008 concluded that the competence to establish and maintain
        good teacher\u2013student relations is a central and important one for a teacher
        in today\u2019s schools. Together with teaching competence and classroom management
        competence, other competencies that are decisive for learning outcomes include
        the teacher\u2019s knowledge of and ability to establish relations, to feel
        empathy, respect and tolerance, and to take an interest in the students and
        their potential. Nordenbo and colleagues\u2019 findings correspond with the
        results from other meta-studies, and hence, research quite unanimously concludes
        that relations matter. However, a closer definition and breakdown into concrete
        skills is impeded not only at theoretical and definitional levels, but also
        at a practical level. How can relational competence be described theoretically?
        And can relational competence be learnt and trained in the context of teacher
        education at all? In a current development and research project of the Bachelor

        are essential for survival. Their primary function is to support aerobic respiration
        and to provide energy for intracellular metabolic pathways. Paraquat is a
        redox cycling agent capable of generating reactive oxygen species. The aim
        of the present study was to evaluate changes in cortical and striatal mitochondrial
        function in an experimental model of acute paraquat toxicity and to compare
        if the brain areas and the molecular mechanisms involved were similar to those
        observed after chronic exposure. Sprague-Dawley rats received paraquat (25\_mg/Kg
        i.p.) or saline and were sacrificed after 24\_h. Paraquat treatment decreased
        complex I and IV activity by 37 and 21\_% respectively in striatal mitochondria.
        Paraquat inhibited striatal state 4 and state 3 KCN-sensitive respiration
        by 80\_% and 62\_% respectively, indicating a direct effect on respiratory
        chain. An increase of 2.2 fold in state 4 and 2.3 fold in state 3 in KCN-insensitive
        respiration was observed in striatal mitochondria from paraquat animals, suggesting
        that paraquat redox cycling also consumed oxygen. Paraquat treatment increased

        and non-enzymatic antioxidants provide protection against reactive oxygen
        species in humans and other organisms. The nonenzymatic antioxidants include
        low molecular mass molecules such as plant-derived phenols.Aim of studyThis
        study identified the major phenolic compounds of a grape seed extract by HPLC
        and analyzed the effect of consumption of biscuits enriched with this extract
        on the urinary oxidative status of healthy subjects by measurement of urine
        redox potential.MethodsThe major phenolic compounds were characterized in
        a red grape seed extract separated by HPLC with detection by a photodiode
        array (PDA), fluorescence (FL) and quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS). A nutritional
        study in a healthy volunteers group was done. Each volunteer ate eight traditional
        biscuits with no red grape seed extract supplementation. The second day each
        volunteer ate eight traditional biscuits supplemented with 0.6\_% (wt/wt)
        of grape seed extract. An overnight urine sample was obtained for each treatment.
        The redox potential was measured at 25\_\xB0C using a potentiometer in each
        urine sample.ResultsEpicatechin, catechin, procyanidin dimers B1 to B4, and
        the procyanidin trimer C2 were the major phenolic components in the extract.
        Epicatechin gallate and procyanidin dimers B1-3-G and B2-3\u2032-G were the
        major galloylated flavan-3-ols. The forty-six healthy volunteers each shown
        a reduction of the urine redox potential after the treatment by traditional
        biscuits supplemented with the grape seed extract.ConclusionsThis simple dietary
        intervention significantly reduced (33\_%) the urine redox potential, reflecting
        an overall increase in antioxidant status. Incorporation of plant-derived
        phenols in the diet may increase anti-oxidative status.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4439-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4439-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4439-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10967-015-4439-0\"}],\"title\":\"Meridional

        in a cohort of 507 AML cases with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. In addition,
        a cohort of 475 healthy controls was analyzed for this polymorphism. IDH1

        Cases with IDH1 105^GGT minor allele as compared to those with the IDH1 105^GGC

        is a rare, benign tumor with atypical clinical symptoms. Because of its small
        size, it is difficult to diagnose and treat early; therefore, it leads to
        poor quality of life. Glomus tumors are known to commonly affect the hand
        and rarely manifest in other areas. Because they simulate neuromas, hemangiomas,
        and neurofibromatosis, the differential diagnosis is difficult. We performed
        marginal resection of a solitary forearm mass previously suspected to be a
        hemangioma or glomus tumor on the basis of ultrasound findings and histologically
        diagnosed to be a glomus tumor afterward. We report this case to demonstrate
        the good prognosis of the procedure we used, and we review the relevant literature.Case
        presentationA 68-year-old Asian man without a particular medical history visited
        our hospital with a mass with focal tenderness in his left distal forearm
        that had developed 8 years earlier. The tumor was observed with suspicion
        of being a hemangioma or glomus tumor based on the location, clinical symptoms,
        and ultrasound findings taken into consideration together. The biopsy results
        led us to conclude that the lesion was a glomus tumor.ConclusionsA glomus
        tumor located in the forearm is very rare. It is often clinically overlooked
        and is likely to be misdiagnosed as another disease. The patient\u2019s quality
        of life deteriorates, and, though the disease is rare, it has serious sequelae.
        Therefore, a quick diagnosis and appropriate treatment must be conducted early.
        If a mass occurs with serious pain in subcutaneous soft tissue of not the
        hands but the limbs, it is important to conduct examinations with suspicion
        of a glomus tumor. Ultrasonography performed quickly may be useful for making
        the differential diagnosis.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12134-015-0464-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12134-015-0464-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12134-015-0464-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12134-015-0464-7\"}],\"title\":\"Immigrant-Friendly

        continues to be an issue in the USA. In the absence of substantive Federal

        some have had anti-immigrant orientations. In the literature, these types

        knowledge is used in public health practice to make sense of research findings.
        Although knowledge translation theories highlight the importance of informal
        knowledge, it is not clear to what extent the same literature provides guidance
        in terms of how to use it in practice. The objective of this study was to
        address this gap by exploring what planned action theories suggest in terms
        of using three types of informal knowledge: local, experiential and expert.
        We carried out an exploratory secondary analysis of the planned action theories
        that informed the development of a popular knowledge translation theory. Our
        sample included twenty-nine (n\_=\_29) papers. We extracted information from
        these papers about sources of and guidance for using informal knowledge, and
        then carried out a thematic analysis.ResultsWe found that theories of planned
        action provide guidance (including sources of, methods for identifying, and
        suggestions for use) for using local, experiential and expert knowledge.ConclusionThis
        study builds on previous knowledge translation related work to provide insight
        into the practical use of informal knowledge. Public health practitioners
        can refer to the guidance summarized in this paper to inform their decision-making.
        Further research about how to use informal knowledge in public health practice
        is needed given the value being accorded to using informal knowledge in public

        that Ni diffuses to the Cu surface and participates in the graphene growth

        control on planetary dynamos is often studied by imposing heterogeneous core-mantle
        boundary (CMB) heat flux patterns on the outer boundary of numerical dynamo
        simulations. These patterns typically enter two main categories: Either they
        are proportional to seismic tomography models of Earth\u2019s lowermost mantle
        to simulate realistic conditions, or they are represented by single spherical
        harmonics for fundamental physical understanding. However, in reality the
        dynamics in the lower mantle is much more complicated and these CMB heat flux
        models are most likely oversimplified. Here we term alternative any CMB heat
        flux pattern imposed on numerical dynamos that does not fall into these two
        categories, and instead attempts to account for additional complexity in the
        lower mantle. We review papers that attempted to explain various dynamo-related
        observations by imposing alternative CMB heat flux patterns on their dynamo
        models. For present-day Earth, the alternative patterns reflect non-thermal
        contributions to seismic anomalies or sharp features not resolved by global
        tomography models. Time-dependent mantle convection is invoked for capturing
        past conditions on Earth\u2019s CMB. For Mars, alternative patterns account
        for localized heating by a giant impact or a mantle plume. Recovered geodynamo-related
        observations include persistent morphological features of present-day core
        convection and the geomagnetic field as well as the variability in the geomagnetic
        reversal frequency over the past several hundred Myr. On Mars the models aim
        at explaining the demise of the paleodynamo or the hemispheric crustal magnetic
        dichotomy. We report the main results of these studies, discuss their geophysical
        implications, and speculate on some future prospects.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s40011-015-0628-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40011-015-0628-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40011-015-0628-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40011-015-0628-4\"}],\"title\":\"Effect

        study aimed to design inflammatory models induced by LPS in vivo and in vitro
        to investigate the anti-inflammation of DLP ethanol extract (EEDL) and the
        potential mechanisms.MethodsEEDL was prepared and then analyzed by high performance
        liquid chromatography (HPLC). Further, the anti-inflammatory effects of EEDL
        in vivo was evaluated by measuring inflammation-associated factors includingcytokines,
        chemokines and acute phase proteins in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mice
        serum and liver. The anti-inflammatory mechanism exploration of EEDL was performed
        in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Different effects of EEDL on nitric oxide
        (NO) and prostaglandin (PG)E_2 secretion were investigated by Griess reagent
        method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Then the
        mRNA and protein expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase
        (COX)-2 were measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain
        reaction (RT-PCR), ELISA and Western blot. Other chemokines and acute phase
        proteins were determined by proteome profile array. Finally, the ELISA based
        transcription factor assay was applied to measure the DNA-binding activity
        of nuclear transcription factor (NF)-\u03BAB p65.ResultsEight compounds from
        EEDL have been identified as gallic acid, salvianic acid, puerarin, daidzin,
        paeoniflorin, salvianolic acid B, cryptotanshinone, and tanshinone IIA, with
        amounts of 0.26, 9.84, 10.41, 2.55, 9.44, 3.82, 0.24 and 0.3\_mg/kg, respectively.
        In vivo , EEDL administration antagonized the up-regulation of more than 17
        kinds of cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins in LPS-treated mice
        serum, and inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA and protein expression in mice
        liver tissue. In vitro , LPS-induced NO and PGE_2 over-productions were decreased
        by EEDL treatment. The mRNA and protein expression of iNOS, COX-2 and IL-6
        were similarly inhibited by EEDL treatment, which might be attributed to decrease
        the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03BAB p65.ConclusionEEDL was valid for anti-inflammation
        and the potential molecular mechanisms might be due to the inhibition of of
        LPS-induced iNOS/NO, COX-2/PGE_2 and cytokines expression by antagonizing

        Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractBackgroundRadiotherapy
        of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) often delivers considerable radiation dose
        to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This may lead to radiation-induced trismus,
        which can have impact on the quality of life of post-radiotherapy (post-RT)
        patients. However, the exact cause of trismus and its relationship with dose
        has not been fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate the quantitative
        relationship between severity of post-RT trismus and TMJ doses and other patient
        characteristics. Through ultrasound examination, this study also aimed to
        identify factors affecting morphological changes of TMJ.MethodsNinety-seven
        NPC patients treated by radiotherapy for more than 4\_years were recruited.
        The doses to both sides of the TMJ were calculated from the treatment planning
        system. The severity of trismus was assessed by measuring the maximum inter-incisal
        distance (MID) with a caliper. Ultrasonography examination of the both sides
        of TMJ was performed in both transverse and longitudinal directions. For the
        scan of each TMJ, the MID, irregularity of mandibular condyle and the echogenicity
        of the joint disc ligament and pterygoid muscles were assessed.ResultsThe
        median age of all the subjects was 56\_years, with median post-RT duration
        of 14\_years and median mean TMJ dose of 64.15\_Gy. The MID (median, 3.7\_cm,
        range, 1.3\u20135.2\_cm) demonstrated strong negative correlations with post-RT
        duration ( r _p\u2009=\u2009\u22120.441, p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.0005) and
        mean doses to the TMJ ( r _p\u2009=\u2009\u22120.262, p \u2009=\u20090.009).
        The negative relationship between TMJ dose and maximum disc thickness (MDT)
        was also found in transverse scan ( r _p\u2009=\u2009\u22120.218, p \u2009=\u20090.002).
        However, there is no significant relationship between TMJ dose and MDT in
        longitudinal scan, irregularity of condyle and echogenicity of pterygoid muscle.ConclusionIn
        post-RT NPC patients, the severity of trismus, expressed in MID, increased
        with the doses to the TMJ and post-RT duration. In addition, the joint disc
        thickness decreased with increased dose to TMJ. Keeping a reasonably low TMJ
        dose in treatment planning and longer-term monitoring of the trismus of post-RT
        NPC patients are suggested to ensure their quality of life.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10032-015-0253-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10032-015-0253-z\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10032-015-0253-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10032-015-0253-z\"}],\"title\":\"g-DICE:

        homeostasis in humans and animals. Autophagy has been categorized as a mechanism
        of intracellular degradation, recycling, defense, and survival. To date, three
        types of autophagy have been identified: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and
        chaperone-mediated autophagy. Recent discoveries strongly suggest that macroautophagy
        also modulates type II programmed cell death under specific circumstances.
        Autophagy and apoptosis are fundamentally distinct processes, but are interconnected
        by common stress initiators and intermediate regulators. During the past two
        decades, the role of amino acid metabolism and signaling in the regulation

        interactions play a key role in successful haematogenous metastasis. Disseminated
        malignancy is the leading cause of death among ovarian cancer patients. It
        is unknown why different ovarian cancers have different metastatic phenotypes.
        To investigate if platelet-cancer cell interactions play a role, we characterized
        the response of ovarian cancer cell lines to platelets both functionally and
        at a molecular level.MethodsCell lines 59\_M and SK-OV-3 were used as in vitro
        model systems of metastatic ovarian cancer. Platelet cloaking of each cell
        line was quantified by flow cytometry. Matrigel invasion chamber assays were
        used to assess the invasive capacity of the cell lines. The induction of an
        EMT was assessed by morphology analysis and by gene expression analysis of
        a panel of 11 EMT markers using TaqMan RT-PCR.ResultsSK-OV-3 cells adhered
        to and activated more platelets than 59\_M cells ( p \u2009=\u20090.0333).
        Platelets significantly promoted the ability of only SK-OV-3 cells to invade
        ( p\u2009\u2264 \u20090.0001). Morphology and transcritpome analysis indicated
        that platelets induce an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype in
        both cells lines, with a more exaggerated response in SK-OV-3 cells. Next,
        we investigated if antiplatelet agents could abrogate the platelet-induced
        aggressive phenotype in SK-OV-3 cells. Both aspirin ( p\u2009\u2264 \u20090.05)
        and 2-methylthioadenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate triethylammonium salt hydrate
        (P2Y_12 inhibitor; p\u2009\u2264 \u20090.01) significantly decreased their
        invasion capacity, and effectively reverted invasion to levels comparable
        to SK-OV-3 cells alone.ConclusionWhile there is increasing evidence for the
        cancer-protective effect of aspirin, this study suggests P2Y_12 inhibition
        may also play a role. Understanding these complex interactions between platelets
        and cancer cells could ultimately allow the establishment of therapies tailored
        to inhibiting metastasis, thus significantly reducing cancer morbidity.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00199-015-0910-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00199-015-0910-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00199-015-0910-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00199-015-0910-y\"}],\"title\":\"Partially

        recovery is associated with production of large quantity of groundwater. The
        coal seams are depressurized by pumping of water for regular and consistent
        gas production. Usually, CBM operators need to pump \\u003e10\_m^3 of water
        per day from one well, which depends on the aquifer characteristics, drainage
        and recharge pattern. In India, 32 CBM blocks have been awarded for exploration
        and production, out of which six blocks are commercially producing methane
        gas at 0.5 million metric standard cubic feet per day. Large amount of water
        is being produced from CBM producing blocks, but no specific information or
        data are available for geochemical properties of CBM-produced water and its
        suitable disposal or utilization options for better management. CBM operators
        are in infancy and searching for the suitable solutions for optimal management
        of produced water. CBM- and mine-produced water needs to be handled considering
        its physical and geochemical assessment, because it may have environmental
        as well as long-term impact on aquifer. Investigations were carried out to
        evaluate geochemical and hydrogeological conditions of CBM blocks in Raniganj
        Basin. Totally, 15 water samples from CBM well head and nine water samples
        from mine disposal head were collected from Raniganj Basin. The chemical signature
        of produced water reveals high sodium and bicarbonate concentrations with
        low calcium and magnesium, and very low sulphate in CBM water. It is comprehend
        that CBM water is mainly of Na\u2013HCO_3 type and coal mine water is of Ca\u2013Mg\u2013SO_4
        and HCO_3\u2013Cl\u2013SO_4 type. The comparative studies are also carried
        out for CBM- and mine-produced water considering the geochemical properties,
        aquifer type, depth of occurrence and lithological formations. Suitable options
        like impounding, reverse osmosis, irrigation and industrial use after prerequisite
        treatments are suggested. However, use of this huge volume of CBM- and mine-produced
        water for irrigation or other beneficial purposes may require careful management
        based on water pH, EC, TDS, alkalinity, bicarbonate, sodium, fluoride, metals

        expression of morphine by plants, invertebrate, and vertebrate cells and organ
        systems, strongly indicates a high level of evolutionary conservation of morphine
        and related morphinan alkaloids as required for life. The prototype catecholamine,
        dopamine, serves as an essential chemical intermediate in morphine biosynthesis,
        both in plants and animals. We surmise that, before the emergence of specialized
        plant and animal cells/organ systems, primordial multi-potential cell types
        required selective mechanisms to limit their responsiveness to environmental
        cues. Accordingly, cellular systems that emerged with the potential for recruitment
        of the free radical gas nitric oxide (NO) as a multi-faceted autocrine/paracrine
        signaling molecule, were provided with extremely positive evolutionary advantages.
        Endogenous morphinergic signaling, in concert with NO-coupled signaling systems,
        has evolved as an autocrine/paracrine regulator of metabolic homeostasis,

        The Author(s)\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractA different approach
        to studying solar spectral irradiance (SSI) variations, without the need for
        long-term (multi-year) instrument degradation corrections, is examining the
        total energy of the irradiance variation during 6-month periods. This duration
        is selected because a solar active region typically appears suddenly and then
        takes 5 to 7 months to decay and disperse back into the quiet-Sun network.
        The solar outburst energy, which is defined as the irradiance integrated over
        the 6-month period and thus includes the energy from all phases of active
        region evolution, could be considered the primary cause for the irradiance
        variations. Because solar cycle variation is the consequence of multiple active
        region outbursts, understanding the energy spectral variation may provide
        a reasonable estimate of the variations for the 11-year solar activity cycle.
        The moderate-term (6-month) variations from the Solar Radiation and Climate
        Experiment (SORCE) instruments can be decomposed into positive (in-phase with
        solar cycle) and negative (out-of-phase) contributions by modeling the variations
        using the San Fernando Observatory (SFO) facular excess and sunspot deficit
        proxies, respectively. These excess and deficit variations are fit over 6-month
        intervals every 2 months over the mission, and these fitted variations are
        then integrated over time for the 6-month energy. The dominant component indicates
        which wavelengths are in-phase and which are out-of-phase with solar activity.
        The results from this study indicate out-of-phase variations for the 1400\u2009\u2013\u20091600\_nm

        from women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at risk for later
        overweight, and the aim of treatment regimens is to normalize their prognosis.
        While the general concept is that breastfeeding is protective and should be
        promoted, some studies report increased levels of insulin and glucose in breast
        milk of women with diabetes, possibly increasing risks to the children. Previous
        studies may have low retention rates or mix GDM and pre-GDM, and often knowledge
        of confounders like maternal body mass index (BMI), level of hyperglycemia
        and feeding patterns is lacking. Data on breastfeeding rates, growth patterns
        and their associations are important to optimize future strategies among offspring
        from women with GDM managed by diet.MethodsBased on 10.730 births, a cohort
        of 131 singletons of Danish women with GDM managed by diet was defined. Data
        on feeding patterns, offspring length, weight and head circumference were
        obtained at the initial admission and from examinations by the general practitioner
        at five weeks and at five months postpartum. Breastfeeding rates were described
        in relation to neonatal and maternal characteristics and compared to national
        rates, while anthropometric data were compared to reference standards. The
        association between breastfeeding and offspring growth was analysed with and
        without correcting for confounding.ResultsMore than 99\_% of the cohort contributed
        to anthropometric data, while data on feeding patterns were available for
        96\u201398\_%. Of mothers, 8\_% did not initiate breastfeeding and the rate
        of fully breastfeeding at five weeks and at five months of age were 61\_%
        and 18\_%, respectively, which is considerably lower than generally reported
        in Denmark. Lowest breastfeeding rates were seen following prelabour Caesarean
        delivery. Complementary feeding was introduced earlier than recommended among
        11\_%. At the age of five weeks and at five months, children had grown longer
        and had lower BMI than expected from Danish and World Health Organization
        references. In the study periods, breastfeeding was significantly associated
        with lower BMI.ConclusionDespite lower breastfeeding rates than normally reported
        in Denmark, offspring BMI at the age of five months were low. Still new initiatives
        to promote breastfeeding among Danish women with GDM should be considered.\"}],\"facets\":[{\"name\":\"subject\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"Medicine

        ( Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an important staple food in semi-arid tropics
        which contribute to food security and poverty alleviation in Benin. However,
        its production is seriously facing enormous abiotic and biotic stresses including
        climate variability. To document its cultivar diversity, the impact of climate
        change on its production and diversity, the adaptation strategies developed
        by farmers and the performance of landraces, 22 villages were randomly selected
        and surveyed in the Department of Atakora in the northwest of Benin using
        participatory research appraisals (fields and granaries visit, individual
        and group survey using questionnaires, Four cells or distribution and extent
        analysis, etc.). Data were analysed through descriptive statistics (frequencies,
        percentages, means, etc.) to generate summaries and tables at different (villages,
        individuals) levels and also through multivariate analysis (cluster analysis)
        and the results figures. In total 8 constraints affecting sorghum production
        were recorded among which striga proliferation, soil poverty and climate change
        effects (drought; excess of rain; delay, insufficient and irregular rainfall,
        etc.) were the most important. Subject to synonyms, 89 sorghum landraces were
        inventoried and their number varied from 4 to 17 (7 on average) per village.
        The Shannon\u2013Weaver diversity index (H) estimated at 3.02 indicated high
        sorghum diversity in the study area. Many landraces were threatened. The relatively
        high rates (16.7\u201388.2\_%; 40.9\_% on average) of cultivars loss recorded
        per village are proofs of menace of genetic erosion and necessity of developing
        conservation strategies. Inadaptability of cultivars to climate variability
        (39.6\_% of abandoned landraces) was among others the most important reason
        justifying the loss of diversity. Crop rotations, growing of early maturing
        and/or drought tolerant landraces, establishment of fields in lowlands are
        the most important strategies developed by farmers to mitigate impacts of
        climate change (low productivity, increase of damages from storage insects,
        early drying of plant leaves etc.) on the crop. Participatory evaluation of
        the existing landraces led to the identification of some high-performing ones
        that are resistant/tolerant to diverse abiotic and biotic stresses. Farmers\u2019
        cultivars preference criteria were identified and prioritized. Results of
        this study are useful to policy makers, agricultural extension services of
        the different districts, genetic resources specialists and breeders in order

        the present paper we will examine methodological frameworks to study complex
        genetic diseases (e.g. cancer) from the stand point of theoretical-computational
        biology combining both data-driven and hypothesis driven approaches. Our work
        focuses in the apparent counterpoint between two formal approaches to research
        in natural science: data- and hypothesis-driven inquiries. For a long time
        philosophers have recognized the mechanistic character of molecular biology
        explanations. On these grounds we suggest that hypothesis and data-driven
        approaches are not opposed to each other but that they may be integrated by
        the development of what we call enriched mechanistic models .MethodsWe will
        elaborate around a case study from our laboratory that analyzed the relationship
        between transcriptional de-regulation of sets of genes that present both transcription
        factor and metabolic activity while at the same time have been associated
        with the presence of cancer. The way we do this is by analyzing structural,
        mechanistic and functional approaches to molecular level research in cancer
        biology. Emphasis will be given to data integration strategies to construct
        new explanations.ResultsSuch analysis has led us to present a mechanistic-enriched
        model of the phenomenon. Such model pointed out to the way in which regulatory
        and thermodynamical behavior of gene regulation networks may be analyzed by
        means of gene expression data obtained from genome-wide analysis experiments
        in RNA from biopsy-captured tissue. The foundations of the model are given
        by the laws of thermodynamics and chemical physics and the approach is an
        enriched version of a mechanistic explanation.ConclusionAfter analyzing the
        way we studied the coupling of metabolic and transcriptional deregulation
        in breast cancer, we have concluded that one plausible strategy to integrate
        data driven and hypothesis driven approaches is by means of resorting to fundamental
        and well established laws of physics and chemistry since these provide a solid

        focus in the literature on scientific explanation has shifted in recent years
        towards model-based approaches. In recent work, Alisa Bokulich has argued
        that idealization has a central role to play in explanation. Bokulich claims
        that certain highly-idealized, structural models can be explanatory, even
        though they are not considered explanatory by causal, mechanistic, or covering
        law accounts of explanation. This paper focuses on Bokulich\u2019s account
        in order to make the more general claim that there are problems with maintaining
        that a structural criterion can capture the way that highly-idealized models
        explain. This paper examines Bokulich\u2019s claim that the structural model
        explanation of quantum wavefunction scarring, featuring semiclassical mechanics,
        is deeper than the explanation provided by the local quantum model. The challenge
        for Bokulich is to show that the semiclassical model answers a wider range
        of w-questions (what-if-things-had-been-different-questions), as this is her
        method of assessing structural information. I look at two reasonable approaches
        employing w-questions, and I argue that neither approach is ultimately satisfactory.
        Because structural similarity has preferences for more fundamental models,
        I argue that the local quantum model provides explanations that at least as
        deep as the semiclassical ones. The criterion either wrongly identifies all
        models as explanatory, or prefers models from fundamental theory. Either way,
        it cannot capture the way that highly-idealized models explain.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10646-015-1535-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10646-015-1535-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10646-015-1535-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-015-1535-4\"}],\"title\":\"The

        In the present paper, an environmentally friendly alternative to pesticide
        application has been studied, based on the so-called electrochemically activated
        solutions (ECAS). Experiments have been carried out, by applying ECAS having
        different contents of active ingredients, on tobacco plants at a laboratory
        scale and on apple trees at fruit garden scale. The results, accumulated during
        a couple of years, have shown that properly selected dilute solutions of chlorides,
        once activated by an electrochemical treatment, exhibit a very effective protecting
        action of plants, irrespective of their nature. Extension of the research
        has shown that the observed effect is the result of two distinct factors:
        the expected anti-microbial action of the electrochemically synthesized oxidants,
        and an unexpected priming of immune plant defenses, which is clearly due to
        the treatment with ECAS. Interestingly, the repetition of ECAS application
        triggers an even stronger activation of defense genes. No oxidative damages,
        due to the use of the activated solutions, could be detected.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s13054-015-1026-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s13054-015-1026-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13054-015-1026-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13054-015-1026-2\"}],\"title\":\"Development

        first steps in goal-directed therapy for sepsis are early diagnosis followed
        by appropriate triage. These steps are usually left to the physician\u2019s
        judgment, as there is no accepted biomarker available. We aimed to determine
        biomarker phenotypes that differentiate children with sepsis who require intensive
        care from those who do not.MethodsWe conducted a prospective, observational
        nested cohort study at two pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and one
        pediatric emergency department (ED). Children ages 2\u201317 years presenting
        to the PICU or ED with sepsis or presenting for procedural sedation to the
        ED were enrolled. We used the judgment of regional pediatric ED and PICU attending
        physicians as the standard to determine triage location (PICU or ED). We performed
        metabolic and inflammatory protein mediator profiling with serum and plasma
        samples, respectively, collected upon presentation, followed by multivariate
        statistical analysis.ResultsNinety-four PICU sepsis, 81 ED sepsis, and 63
        ED control patients were included. Metabolomic profiling revealed clear separation
        of groups, differentiating PICU sepsis from ED sepsis with accuracy of 0.89,
        area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.96 (standard
        deviation [SD] 0.01), and predictive ability ( Q ^2) of 0.60. Protein mediator
        profiling also showed clear separation of the groups, differentiating PICU
        sepsis from ED sepsis with accuracy of 0.78 and AUROC of 0.88 (SD 0.03). Combining
        metabolomic and protein mediator profiling improved the model ( Q ^2 =0.62),
        differentiating PICU sepsis from ED sepsis with accuracy of 0.87 and AUROC
        of 0.95 (SD 0.01). Separation of PICU sepsis or ED sepsis from ED controls
        was even more accurate. Prespecified age subgroups (2\u20135 years old and
        6\u201317 years old) improved model accuracy minimally. Seventeen metabolites
        or protein mediators accounted for separation of PICU sepsis and ED sepsis
        with 95 % confidence.ConclusionsIn children ages 2\u201317 years, combining
        metabolomic and inflammatory protein mediator profiling early after presentation
        may differentiate children with sepsis requiring care in a PICU from children
        with or without sepsis safely cared for outside a PICU. This may aid in making
        triage decisions, particularly in an ED without pediatric expertise. This
        finding requires validation in an independent cohort.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11262-015-1245-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11262-015-1245-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11262-015-1245-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-015-1245-2\"}],\"title\":\"Genetic

        each cluster can be handled separately and in parallel by using cloud computing
        which is effectively applied in various applications for a large data analysis.
        In the second step, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II which is a

        significantly upregulated by disrupting caveolin-dependent endocytosis with
        filipin III. In addition, cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization,
        did not affect the Kv1.3 expression. Thus, blocking of the Kv1.3 channel enhances
        the phagocytic capacity and NO production of this cell line. Our results suggest
        that Kv1.3 channel serves as a negative regulator of phagocytosis in macrophages
        and can therefore be a potential target in the treatment of macrophage dysfunction.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11325-015-1241-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11325-015-1241-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11325-015-1241-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11325-015-1241-8\"}],\"title\":\"Multi-level

        aim of this study was to compare results in patients with obstructive sleep
        apnea (OSA) undergoing multi-level surgery with two different surgical approaches
        to treat tongue base obstruction.Study designThis is a prospective, controlled
        clinical trial at a tertiary referral center.MethodsAltogether, 108 patients
        were separated into two groups according to the findings during drug-induced
        sleep endoscopy. Patients with enlarged lingual tonsils ( N \u2009=\u200958;
        group A) underwent a lingual tonsillectomy (LT). Patients with small or absent
        lingual tonsils ( N \u2009=\u200950; group B) underwent a hyoid suspension
        type 2 (HS) in combination with a radiofrequency treatment of the base of
        the tongue (RFT TB). In addition, all patients underwent an uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
        with tonsillectomy.ResultsAt baseline, there were no significant differences
        between the groups. In group A, the mean apnea hypopnea index (AHI) decreased
        by 49.7\_%, and in group B by 48.3\_%. Patients with simultaneous tonsillectomies
        showed significant better results as compared to patients after prior tonsillectomies
        (success rate 76.6 vs. 27.3\_%). By comparing subgroups (with and without
        simultaneous tonsillectomy), patients in group A showed better results in
        terms of AHI reduction than patients in group B, indicating that LT may be
        superior to HS\u2009+\u2009RFT TB in treating OSA within our multi-level surgery
        concept.ConclusionSimultaneous tonsillectomy has a significant impact on objective
        results of multi-level surgery (MLS). Study results should be adjusted for
        this parameter. Having done this, MLS with LT seems to produce superior results
        as compared to HS\u2009+\u2009RFT TB. Nevertheless, our approach to treat
        patients differently according to their tongue base tonsil size did not substantially
        improve our surgical outcome as compared to a previous study.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4442-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4442-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4442-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10967-015-4442-5\"}],\"title\":\"Spatial

        revealing transfer effects of working memory (WM) training on non-trained
        cognitive performance of children hold promising implications for scholastic
        learning. However, the results of existing training studies are not consistent
        and provoke debates about the potential and limitations of cognitive enhancement.
        To examine the influence of individual differences on training outcomes is
        a promising approach for finding causes for such inconsistencies. In this
        study, we implemented WM training in an elementary school setting. The aim
        was to investigate near and far transfer effects on cognitive abilities and
        academic achievement and to examine the moderating effects of a dispositional
        and a regulative temperament factor, neuroticism and effortful control. Ninety-nine
        second-graders were randomly assigned to 20 sessions of computer-based adaptive
        WM training, computer-based reading training, or a no-contact control group.
        For the WM training group, our analyses reveal near transfer on a visual WM
        task, far transfer on a vocabulary task as a proxy for crystallized intelligence,
        and increased academic achievement in reading and math by trend. Considering
        individual differences in temperament, we found that effortful control predicts
        larger training mean and gain scores and that there is a moderation effect
        of both temperament factors on post-training improvement: WM training condition
        predicted higher post-training gains compared to both control conditions only
        in children with high effortful control or low neuroticism. Our results suggest
        that a short but intensive WM training program can enhance cognitive abilities
        in children, but that sufficient self-regulative abilities and emotional stability
        are necessary for WM training to be effective.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11274-015-1944-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11274-015-1944-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11274-015-1944-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1944-9\"}],\"title\":\"Laccase

        reveals that giraffes ( Giraffa camelopardalis sp.) exhibit a socially structured,
        fission\u2013fusion system. In other species possessing this kind of society,
        information exchange is important and vocal communication is usually well
        developed. But is this true for giraffes? Giraffes are known to produce sounds,
        but there is no evidence that they use vocalizations for communication. Reports
        on giraffe vocalizations are mainly anecdotal and the missing acoustic descriptions
        make it difficult to establish a call nomenclature. Despite inconclusive evidence
        to date, it is widely assumed that giraffes produce infrasonic vocalizations
        similar to elephants. In order to initiate a more detailed investigation of
        the vocal communication in giraffes, we collected data of captive individuals
        during day and night. We particularly focussed on detecting tonal, infrasonic
        or sustained vocalizations.FindingsWe collected over 947\_h of audio material
        in three European zoos and quantified the spectral and temporal components
        of acoustic signals to obtain an accurate set of acoustic parameters. Besides
        the known burst, snorts and grunts, we detected harmonic, sustained and frequency-modulated

        that giraffes do produce vocalizations, which, based on their acoustic structure,
        might have the potential to function as communicative signals to convey information
        about the physical and motivational attributes of the caller. The data further
        reveal that the assumption of infrasonic communication in giraffes needs to
        be considered with caution and requires further investigations in future studies.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00033-015-0578-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00033-015-0578-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00033-015-0578-y\"}],\"title\":\"Existence

        threshold \\u003e83 was used to identify patients with a low likelihood of
        osteoporosis. Moreover, we compared QUS results with those of 36 sex- and
        age-matched HIV-negative controls.Results244 HIV-positive patients were enrolled.
        Median heel QUI value was 83 (73\u201396) vs. 93 (IQR 84\u2013104) in the
        control group ( p \_=\_0.04). 110 patients (45\_%) had a QUI value \u226483.
        Risk factors for low QUI values were age (OR 1.04 per year, 95\_% CI 1.01\u20131.07,
        p \_=\_0.004), current use of protease inhibitors (OR 1.85, CI 1.03\u20133.35,
        p \_=\_0.039), current use of tenofovir (OR 2.28, CI 1.22\u20134.27, p \_=\_0.009)
        and the number of risk factors for secondary osteoporosis (OR 1.46, CI 1.09\u20131.95,
        p \_=\_0.01). Of note, QUI values were significantly correlated with FRAX
        score (r\_=\_\u22120.22, p \_=\_0.004). According to EACS guidelines, 45\_%
        of patients had risk factors for osteoporosis which make them eligible for
        DXA. By using QUS, we may avoid DXA in around half of them.ConclusionsAs HIV-positive
        patients are living longer, the prevalence of osteoporosis is expected to
        increase over time. Appropriate screening, prevention and treatment are crucial
        to preserve bone health in this population. The use of screening techniques,
        such as heel QUS, may help reducing the need for DXA. Further studies are
        needed to define the diagnostic accuracy of this promising technique in the
        setting of HIV.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00404-015-3875-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00404-015-3875-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00404-015-3875-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00404-015-3875-y\"}],\"title\":\"Molecular

        These tumors exhibit biphasic histologic and immunophenotypic features, reflecting

        into primary (de novo) tumors, and secondary gliosarcomas, which are diagnosed
        at recurrence after a diagnosis of glioblastoma. Using a retrospective review,
        patients seen at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2004 and 2014 with a pathology-confirmed
        diagnosis of gliosarcoma were identified. 34 patients with a diagnosis of
        gliosarcoma seen at the time of initial diagnosis or at recurrence were identified
        (24 primary gliosarcomas (PGS), 10 secondary gliosarcomas (SGS)). Molecular
        analysis performed on fourteen patients revealed a high incidence of TP53
        mutations and, rarely, EGFR and IDH mutations. Median overall survival (OS)
        for all patients was 17.5\_months from the diagnosis of gliosarcoma, with
        a progression free survival (PFS) of 6.4\_months. Comparing PGS with SGS,
        the median OS was 24.7 and 8.95\_months, respectively (from the time of sarcomatous

        analysis revealed a higher than expected rate of TP53 mutations in GS patients
        and, typical of primary glioblastoma, IDH mutations were uncommon. Though

        is not only an important crop, but its large (17 Gb), highly repetitive, and
        hexaploid genome makes it a good model to study the organization and evolution
        of complex genomes. Recently, we produced a high quality reference sequence
        of wheat chromosome 3B (774\_Mb), which provides an excellent opportunity
        to study the evolutionary dynamics of a large and polyploid genome, specifically
        the impact of single gene duplications.ResultsWe find that 27\_% of the 3B
        predicted genes are non-syntenic with the orthologous chromosomes of Brachypodium
        distachyon , Oryza sativa , and Sorghum bicolor , whereas, by applying the
        same criteria, non-syntenic genes represent on average only 10\_% of the predicted
        genes in these three model grasses. These non-syntenic genes on 3B have high
        sequence similarity to at least one other gene in the wheat genome, indicating
        that hexaploid wheat has undergone massive small-scale interchromosomal gene
        duplications compared to other grasses. Insertions of non-syntenic genes occurred
        at a similar rate along the chromosome, but these genes tend to be retained
        at a higher frequency in the distal, recombinogenic regions. The ratio of
        non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates showed a more relaxed selection
        pressure for non-syntenic genes compared to syntenic genes, and gene ontology
        analysis indicated that non-syntenic genes may be enriched in functions involved
        in disease resistance.ConclusionOur results highlight the major impact of
        single gene duplications on the wheat gene complement and confirm the accelerated

        occurring at the feet while wearing footwear is often determined using pressure
        measurement systems. However, other forms of stress, such as bending, torsional
        and shear loadings, cannot be detected in shoes during day-to-day activities.
        Nevertheless, the detection of these types of stresses would be helpful for
        understanding the mechanical aspects of various kinds of hard and soft tissue
        injuries. Therefore, we describe the development of a new measuring device
        that allows the reliable determination of bending and torsional load at the
        foot in shoes.MethodsThe system consists of a measuring insole and an analogue
        device with Bluetooth interface. The specific shape of the insole base layer,
        the positions of the strain gauges, and the interconnections between them
        have all been selected in such a way so as to isolate bending and torsional
        moment detections in the medial and lateral metatarsal region. The system
        was calibrated using a classical two-point test procedure. A single case study
        was executed to evaluate the new device for practical use. This application
        consisted of one subject wearing neutral shoes walking on a treadmill.ResultsThe
        calibration results (coefficients of determination R^2\u2009\\u003e\u20090.999)
        show that bending and torsional load can be reliably detected using the measurement
        system presented. In the single case study, alternating bending and torsional
        load can be detected during walking, and the shape of the detected bending
        moments can be confirmed by the measurements of Arndt et al. (J Biomech 35:621\u20138,

        of post-burn contractures, following inadequate management of post-burn contractures
        (PBC), is under reported. It is associated with multiple operations and an
        increased cost to patients and their families. The purpose of this study was
        to determine the frequency of recurrence of PBC of the shoulder and the elbow
        joint three months after surgical intervention and the associated risk- factors.MethodsThis
        was a prospective cohort study conducted at CoRSU hospital from March 2012
        to November 2014. All patients with PBC of the elbow and/or shoulder joint
        who consented to be in the study and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled.
        Data was collected using a pretested, coded questionnaire. A goniometer was
        used to measure the active range of motion of the involved joint. The measurements
        were recorded in degrees. The data was analysed with STATA version 12.1.Results58
        patients were enrolled consecutively in the study. There were 36 females and
        22 males, with a female to male ratio of 1.6:1. The age range was 0.75\u201345
        years, with a median age of 5\_years. The average age at the time of injury
        was 3.4\_years. The most common cause of initial burn injury was scalding.
        The average number of joints involved per patient was two. There was a high
        incidence of recurrence of PBC (52\_%) among the participants. The shoulder
        had the highest frequency of recurrence at 67\_%. The elbow joint had a frequency
        of recurrence of 27\_%. All participants with both elbow and shoulder joint
        involvement had PBC recur. The risk factors for recurrence were flame burn
        ( p \u2009=\u20090.007), duration of PBC of more than 1\_year ( p \u2009=\u20090.018),
        and incomplete release of the contracture ( p \u2009=\u20090.002). The presence
        of keloids, hypertrophic scars, ulcers and the occurrence of complications
        at the contracture site were not associated with recurrence of PBC.ConclusionRecurrence
        of PBC of the elbow and shoulder joint is a common problem. The risk factors
        should be kept in mind during management of PBC to reduce the recurrence rate.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00404-015-3879-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00404-015-3879-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00404-015-3879-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00404-015-3879-7\"}],\"title\":\"Therapeutic

        aim of the ongoing DETECT study program is to evaluate therapeutic intervention
        based on phenotypes of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in patients with metastatic
        breast cancer (MBC). Currently (as of July 2015) more than half of the projected
        about 2000 patients with MBC have already been screened for CTC.MethodsWomen
        with HER2-negative primary tumor and presence of CTC are recruited into different
        DETECT trials according to the HER2-phenotype of CTC. Patients with HER2-positive
        CTC are randomized to treatment with physicians\u2019 choice therapy (standard
        chemo- or endocrine therapy) with or without additional HER2-targeted therapy
        with lapatinib in the DETECT III trial. In DETECT IVa, postmenopausal patients
        with hormone-receptor positive primary cancer and HER2-negative CTC receive
        everolimus and standard endocrine therapy. For women with HER2-negative CTC
        and triple negative MBC or hormone-receptor positive tumor and indication
        for chemotherapy, a treatment with eribulin is offered (DETECT IVb). The clinical
        efficacy is investigated by CTC-Clearance and progression-free survival (PFS).
        The DETECT V/CHEVENDO trial extends the DETECT study program for women with
        HER2-positive and hormone-receptor positive MBC. The primary objective of
        this trial is to compare safety and quality of life (QoL) as assessed by the
        occurrence of adverse events in patients treated with dual (trastuzumab plus
        pertuzumab) HER2-targeted therapy plus either endocrine or chemotherapy. The
        translational research projects of the DETECT study program focus on further
        molecular characterization of CTC and evaluation of markers for their suitability
        to predict treatment response and to facilitate the development of more personalized

        industriell z.\_B. mittels Pyrolyseverfahren hergestellt, wobei erste industrielle

        a potential new waste treatment method, as well as its importance in the context
        of soil substrate production (or as a soil amendment) and as an option for
        carbon binding in soils, has only recently attracted attention in Austria.
        Biochar is industrially produced, e.g. by means of pyrolysis, with the first
        industrial production facilities having commenced operations in the last few
        years. With regard to these comparatively new technologies, in most cases
        the environmental impacts still need to be investigated and the production
        methods carefully evaluated. In Austria, one pilot facility for biochar production
        is currently in operation. Investigations and analyses conducted during the
        pilot phase made it possible to prepare the first comprehensive assessment
        of the potential environmentally relevant impacts in connection with the production
        of biochar from diverse biogenic waste flows. The input material used at the
        pilot facility primarily consists of grain husks and paper fiber sludge. For
        the purposes of the environmental assessment, a comprehensive analysis of
        primary data was conducted. Environmentally relevant impacts were evaluated
        on the basis of lifecycle assessment methods in accordance with the European
        norm EN ISO 14040\_ff (Umweltmanagement \xD6kobilanz \u2013 Grunds\xE4tze
        und Rahmenbedingungen, 2006). The results of the assessment are intended to
        help identify optimization potentials on the one hand, and to determine the
        respective advantages and disadvantages of specific types of input material
        on the other. The results show that biochar production yields a positive reductive
        effect on the greenhouse effect: in the production method reviewed here, a
        total of 1.1\_kg CO_2 equivalent could be saved per kilogram (dry weight)
        of biochar produced.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10803-015-2588-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10803-015-2588-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10803-015-2588-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10803-015-2588-1\"}],\"title\":\"Low

        France, about 90,000\_ha per year of arable land become unsuitable for food
        production due to erosion, acidification, sealing and pollution by metallic
        and organic compounds. Bioenergy crops such as Miscanthus x giganteus are
        used to rehabilitate polluted soils for crop production. Although the economic
        potential of this crop is known, the crop abilities to regenerate the soil
        biological properties enabling sustainable crop production still remain unclear.
        Here, we evaluated the effects of the Miscanthus crop on the abundance and
        diversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities in a wastewater-contaminated
        soil, using synchronic and diachronic evaluation strategies. A 3-year field
        experiment, near Paris, was set up on an agricultural field irrigated with
        raw wastewater for more than 100\_years, thus inducing a strong metal and
        organic contamination of the soil. We characterized the abundance and diversity
        of soil microbial communities using metagenomic techniques. Our results show
        that the Miscanthus crop had an early effect on microbial communities by stimulating
        bacterial diversity, by about 20\_%, and fungal diversity, by about 10\_%.
        This positive effect could be explained by the release of fresh organic matter
        from litter decomposition and root exudation, and by the absence of tillage
        and pesticide spraying, which are known to degrade soil microflora. On the
        other hand, no significant effect on microbial biomass has been recorded.

        connection with the external post-mortem examination of corpses the local
        health authorities analyze all death certificates issued in their administrative
        district for completeness and plausibility. If there are indications for an
        unnatural or unclear cause of death the investigating authorities are informed.
        Very few data have so far been published in the forensic literature regarding
        this task of public health services.AimThis study was initiated to identify
        problem areas when filling out death certificates and whether there were differences
        between hospital physicians and physicians in private practices.Material and
        methodsIn the context of an internal quality control monitoring system the
        local health authority of the City of Munich performed a continuous and standardized
        data collection and retrospective evaluation of all death certificates issued
        between 2010 and 2013.ResultsThe mean rate of reclamation of death certificates
        during the investigation period was 7\u2009%. In particular reclamations concerned
        information about personal details of the deceased person (7\u2009%), the
        manner of death (1\u2009%), remarks on the certain signs of death (15.7\u2009%),

        phenomenon since it is not proper to use mathematical methods due to various

        data are used to evaluate the production and maintenance functions. Afterwards,
        the simulation of the activities influenced by the resilience engineering

        periodic maintenance and various policies. At this stage, numerous outputs
        such as the availability of machines and operators, efficiency, queue, and
        reliability are computed. Considering the variety of scenarios involved, Taguchi

        whether pulmonary arterial enlargement predicts cardiopulmonary complications
        following pulmonary resection for lung cancer.MethodsWe reviewed 237 consecutive
        patients who underwent pulmonary resection for lung cancer. Preoperative patient
        characteristics (sex, age, Brinkman index, cardiopulmonary comorbidities,
        cardiothoracic ratio, pulmonary function, and pulmonary arterial enlargement)
        and surgical data (surgical procedure, pathological stage, postoperative complications,
        mortality, and length of postoperative hospital stay) were analyzed. In order
        to evaluate preoperative pulmonary arterial enlargement, we measured the diameter
        of the main pulmonary artery at its bifurcation and that of the ascending
        aorta at its widest point using chest computed tomography and calculated the
        ratio of the former diameter to the latter.ResultsIn all, 16 patients developed
        postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and 221 did not. One patient died
        from postoperative pneumonia. The mean age of patients who developed postoperative
        cardiopulmonary complications was significantly higher than that of those

        Forte et al.\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractIntroductionDue to their
        immunomodulatory properties, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been used
        for auto-immune disease treatment. Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
        are two major inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), resulting from pathological
        immune responses to environmental or microbial antigens. Preclinical and clinical
        studies have suggested that MSC-based cellular therapy hold promising potential
        for IBD treatment. However, open issues include the selection of the proper
        cell dose, the source and the optimal route of administration of MSCs for
        more effective results. Platelet lysate has gained clinical interest due to
        its efficacy in accelerating wound healing. Thus, we propose to combine the
        administration of MSCs with a human umbilical cord blood-derived platelet
        lysate (hCBPL) as a novel strategy to improve MSC-based therapy for IBD resolution.MethodsColitis
        was induced in 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice by daily oral administration of dextran
        sulphate sodium (DSS) (1.5 % w/v in tap water) for 9 days. MSCs were isolated
        from adipose tissue of CD patients (adCD-MSCs), expanded in proliferation
        medium, resuspended in hCBPL or PBS and administrated via enema for three
        times (1 \xD7 10^6 cells/mouse/time) every other day starting on day +7 from
        DSS induction. The colitis evolution was evaluated by daily monitoring of
        body weight, stool consistency and bleeding. Histopathological analysis was
        performed. Inflammatory cytokine plasma levels were determined. adCD-MSCs
        stained with lipophilic membrane dye Nile Red, were injected in DSS mice as
        described above. Colon section of mice sacrificed 24 hours after last cell
        administration, were analyzed by confocal microscopy.ResultsWe found that
        adCD-MSCs could be easily isolated and expanded from CD patients. Upon injection,
        adCD-MSCs exerted a therapeutic effect on DSS-induced colitis. Moreover, hCBPL
        increased adCD-MSCs efficacy by significantly reducing colitis scores, extension
        of the colon inflamed area and plasma levels of inflammatory mediators. Finally,
        Nile Red staining of MSCs is very efficient, stable and does not impair their
        vitality and function. Nile Red-labelling was clearly detected in the colitic
        area of adCD-MSCs injected mice and it was significantly brighter in the colon
        sections of mice that had received adCD-MSCs/hCBPL.ConclusionsIn summary,
        with this study we propose a novel and promising adCD-MSC/hCBPL-based therapy
        for refractory IBDs.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10750-015-2465-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10750-015-2465-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10750-015-2465-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2465-0\"}],\"title\":\"Habitat

        may change in response to food availability. The effects of habitat complexity
        and food item size were experimentally tested on the foraging parameters and
        functional responses of the freshwater fish roach Rutilus rutilus . Habitat
        complexity was varied through the manipulation of substrate and turbidity,
        and food item size was varied by using fishmeal pellets in two sizes. As water
        turbidity and substrate complexity increased, the reaction distance and consumption
        rate (per number) significantly decreased. Increased food item size significantly
        decreased consumption rates (per number) but had no influence on any other
        foraging parameter. Analysis of the interactions between substrate complexity,
        turbidity and food item size revealed food item size had the greatest influence
        on consumption rate (per number). Turbidity had the least effect on all the
        foraging parameters tested. Across all experiments, the functional responses
        were best described by the Type II response, a relatively consistent finding

        material. A laboratory-scale dispersing device was compared with a discontinuously
        working laboratory kneader and a continuously working extruder, both using
        50% less solvent than the dissolver process. Rheological, mechanical, structural,
        conductive, imaging, and electrochemical analyses (C-rate test, long-term
        cycling) were carried out. The dispersing method and time were found to have
        a considerable impact on the structure and electrochemical performance. The
        continuous extrusion process resulted in good performance with more than 20%
        higher specific capacity at elevated C-rates compared with the discontinuous
        process. This can be attributed to better deagglomeration of the carbon black
        in the slurries, also resulting in 60% higher electrode conductivity. On top
        of these positive results, the changes in the drying step due to the reduced

        and discussion of sexual changes with a health professional is a high priority
        for many cancer patients in order to assist with sexual changes and ensure
        that sexual intimacy does not cease post-cancer. The PLISSIT model is widely
        recommended as a framework for providing sexual information and support, allowing
        for the discussion of sexual changes at various levels of increasing intensity.
        The aim of the present study is to evaluate the early stages of the PLISSIT
        model by examining the relative efficacy of written information provision
        about cancer related sexual changes, and information provision accompanied
        by a single session of counselling, for people with cancer and their partners,
        across a range of cancer types.MethodEighty-eight people with cancer and 53
        partners across a range of sexual and non-sexual cancers, took part in a randomised
        trial which adopted mixed method analysis to examine changes in psychological
        wellbeing, quality of life, relationship satisfaction and communication, and
        sexual functioning, following written information provision about cancer related
        sexual changes (self-help condition; SH), or written information accompanied
        by a single session of counselling (health professional condition; HP).ResultsRatings
        of the usefulness and efficacy of the SH and HP interventions, collected through
        analysis of Likert scales, open ended survey items and interviews, indicated
        that both conditions were found to be useful and efficacious by the majority
        of participants, serving to increase awareness of sexuality, improve couple
        communication about sex, and help in the management of sexual changes, through
        the exploration of non-coital sexual practices. In contrast, the quantitative
        analysis of standardized instruments found no significant improvements in
        psychological wellbeing, quality of life, relationship satisfaction and communication,
        or sexual functioning. There were significant reductions in self-silencing
        in the HP condition, and a trend towards increases in sexual satisfaction
        across both conditions.ConclusionThese results offer support for the early
        stages of the PLISSIT model, in terms of normalization and increased awareness
        of sexual changes after cancer, increased couple communication about sexual
        changes, and legitimation of exploration of a range of non-coital sexual practices
        and intimacy. However, more complex and intensive interventions are needed
        to address sexual functioning and psychological wellbeing. The findings provide
        support for the proposition that providing permission to discuss sexuality
        should be the core feature underpinning all stages of interventions designed
        to provide sexuality information and support for people with cancer and their
        partners, and also demonstrate the potential importance of limited information
        and specific suggestions.Trial registrationThis study was registered in the

        verbesserten sich nur die Kenntnisse zur Behandlung von anderen Symptomen

        practical year (PY) during the final year of medical education is intended
        to deepen and broaden knowledge, skills, and abilities that were acquired
        during previous years of their studies. Against this background, this study
        pursues the question of how the knowledge of future physicians and their confidence
        in terms of cancer pain therapy and other palliative care issues develops
        during the PY.Materials and methodsAt the end of the PY, students from two
        university hospitals completed a 3-part online questionnaire (self-assessment
        of the confidence, questions about palliative care knowledge, and assessment
        of palliative care training during the PY). These results are compared with
        previously published data from the same collective that had been collected
        at the beginning of the PY.ResultsOverall, 92 of 318 students participated
        (28.9\u2009%). Less than 10\u2009% of students said that they were more confident
        regarding palliative care topics at the end of their medical studies. Improvements
        in the self-assessment could only be observed in the recognition of and screening
        for cancer pain (increase from 36\u2009% to 65%). With regard to the palliative
        care knowledge, only the knowledge of how to treat symptoms other than pain
        improved significantly; however, knowledge in this regard prior to the PY
        was particularly low (an increase from 25\u2009% to 35\u2009%, p\u2009\\u003c\u20090.05).
        In the only multiple-choice question about ethics, the correct answer rose
        slightly from 51\u2009% (before) to 55\u2009% (after the PY). Of participating
        students, 21% (prior to the PY 27\u2009%) stated that not providing fluids
        to dying patients is a form of euthanasia. In terms of palliative care training,
        between 36 and 83\u2009% of participants stated having insufficient opportunities
        to gain knowledge and experience on various topics in the treatment of patients
        with advanced and incurable diseases during their PY.ConclusionIn the present
        study, considerable deficits in confidence and knowledge regarding palliative
        care issues were also observed at the end of PY. Integration of palliative
        care into the medical school curriculums should be given special attention
        in terms of a longitudinal training of the PY.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00703-015-0403-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00703-015-0403-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00703-015-0403-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00703-015-0403-3\"}],\"title\":\"Sensitivity

        to ascertain model performances with respect to changes in physical and tuning
        parameters which are mainly related to surface, convection, radiation and
        cloud parameterizations. Evaluation was performed for the whole CORDEX-MENA

        combination of available ground observations, satellite products and reanalysis
        data to assess temperature, precipitation, cloud cover and mean sea level
        pressure. The model proved to be very sensitive to changes in physical parameters.
        The optimized configuration allows COSMO-CLM to improve the simulated main

        role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT)
        as well as the prognostic implication of various sites of extracranial disease.
        The records of 73 consecutive patients treated at the University of Rochester
        Medical Center for brain-metastatic melanoma from January 2004 to October
        2013 were reviewed. The median overall survival (OS) was 3.0\_months. Patients
        treated with WBRT alone had decreased OS compared to those treated with SRS
        alone (HR\_=\_0.38, p\_=\_0.001) or WBRT and SRS (HR\_=\_0.51, p\_=\_0.039).
        The mean number of brain metastasis differed (p\_=\_0.002) in patients in
        patients who received WBRT (4.0) compared to those who did not (2.0). Among
        patients with extracranial disease (n\_=\_63), bone metastasis (HR\_=\_1.86,
        p\_=\_0.047, n\_=\_15) was a negative prognostic factor; liver (HR\_=\_1.59,

        metastasis (HR\_=\_1.70, p\_=\_0.15, n\_=\_10) were not. In patients with
        concurrent brain and lung metastasis, those with disease limited to those
        two sites (OS\_=\_8.7 mo, n\_=\_13) had improved OS (HR\_=\_0.44, p\_=\_0.014)
        compared to those with additional disease (OS\_=\_1.8 mo, n\_=\_50). Based
        on this hypothesis-generating retrospective analysis, SRS may offer survival

        video stylization, which is widely used in multimedia entertainment, transforms

        Painterly directional video styles are simulated competently by the orientation

        We also accelerate the video stylization by using the CUDA parallel computing

        hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common neonatal endocrine disorder in infancy.
        Dual oxidase 2 gene ( DUOX2 ) mutations have been reported to be one of the
        leading genetic causes of CH.AimThe aim of this study was to screen for DUOX2
        gene mutations among CH patients in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of
        China and to define the relationships between DUOX2 genotypes and clinical
        phenotypes.Materials and methodsBlood samples were collected from 45 CH patients
        in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, and genomic DNA was extracted
        from peripheral blood leukocytes. All exons of the DUOX2 gene together with
        their exon\u2013intron boundaries were screened by Sanger sequencing.ResultsSequencing
        analysis of DUOX2 in 45 CH patients revealed ten different variants in thirteen
        individuals. The variants included five known mutations, namely c.3329G\\u003eA
        (p.R1110Q), c.1588A\\u003eT (p.K530X), c.2635G\\u003eA (p.E879K), c.2524C\\u003eT
        (p.R842X) and c.4027G\\u003eT (p.L1343F), and one novel frame shift variant
        c.3340delC (p.L1114SfsX56), as well as four novel missense variants c.903G\\u003eT
        (p.W301C), c.2048G\\u003eT (p.R683L), c.1736T\\u003eC (p.L579P) and c.3413C\\u003eA
        (p.A1138D). The variant p.K530X is highly recurrent in our patient cohort
        but the clinical phenotypes vary greatly among those carrying this variant.
        Most patients with monoallelic or biallelic DUOX2 pathogenic variants turned
        out to be cases of transient congenital hypothyroidism (TCH), while three
        patients with triallelic DUOX2 pathogenic variants were associated with permanent
        congenital hypothyroidism (PCH).ConclusionsThe prevalence of DUOX2 pathogenic
        variants was high (29\_%) among patients with CH in Guangxi, China. Monoallelic
        and biallelic DUOX2 pathogenic variants were mainly associated with TCH, while
        triallelic DUOX2 pathogenic variants were associated with PCH. Our study expanded
        the DUOX2 mutation spectrum, and functional studies of the novel mutations
        need to be conducted in the future.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s12891-015-0694-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s12891-015-0694-z\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s12891-015-0694-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12891-015-0694-z\"}],\"title\":\"Effect

        utilization of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is projected to expand
        demand for revision TKA. Revision TKAs are procedurally complex and incur
        high costs on our financially constrained healthcare system. The purpose of
        this study was to use a case-control design to identify factors predisposing
        to revision TKA, particularly demographic, clinical and perioperative technical
        factors.MethodsWe conducted a case control study to investigate patient, surgical
        and perioperative factors associated with greater risk of revision TKA. We
        included patients who received TKA at a tertiary center between 1996 and 2009.
        Cases (patients that had primary and revision TKA) were matched to controls
        (patients with primary TKA that was not revised) in a 1:2 ratio and risk of
        revision examined using conditional logistic regression.ResultsWe identified
        146 cases and 290 controls. Patient factors independently associated with
        revision included male sex (OR 1.73; 95\_% CI 1.06-2.81) and smoking (OR 2.87;
        1.33-6.19). Older age was associated with decreased risk (OR 0.83 per 5-year
        increment; 95\_% CI 0.75-0.92). Lateral release was the only technical factor
        associated with revision (OR 1.92; 1.07-3.43).ConclusionsIn this case control
        study younger patient age, male gender, soft tissue release and active smoking
        status were associated with increased revision risk. Although we do not know
        whether the risk of smoking arises from short- or long-term exposure, smoking
        cessation prior to TKA should be considered as an intervention for decreasing
        revision risk.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11276-015-1064-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11276-015-1064-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11276-015-1064-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11276-015-1064-3\"}],\"title\":\"RA-PSM:

        energy efficiency is one of the most important issues in wireless local area
        networks (WLANs) and a power saving mechanism (PSM) has been proposed in IEEE
        802.11 WLANs. However, the conventional PSMs do not consider multi-rate transmissions
        and thus the waiting time for retrieving buffered frames from the access point
        can be unnecessarily long and more energy can be consumed. In this paper,
        we propose a rate-aware power saving mechanism (RA-PSM) in multi-rate WLANs.
        In RA-PSM, a station sets its contention window size inversely proportional
        to the transmission rate and thus a station with higher transmission rate
        can request the buffered frames at the access point with higher priority.
        As a result, the overall channel waiting time can be reduced and the energy
        consumption can be saved accordingly. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate
        that RA-PSM can reduce the average channel waiting time and the energy consumption
        by up to 77 and 40.3\_%, respectively, compared with the conventional IEEE

        on change detection and change blindness have investigated the nature of visual
        representations by testing the conditions under which observers are able to
        detect when an object in a complex scene changes from one moment to the next.
        Several authors have proposed that change detection can occur without identification
        of the changing object, but the perceptual processes underlying this phenomenon
        are currently unknown. We hypothesized that change detection without localization
        or identification occurs when the change happens outside the focus of attention.
        Such changes would usually go entirely unnoticed, unless the change brings
        about a modification of one of the feature maps representing the scene. Thus,
        the appearance or disappearance of a unique feature might be registered even
        in the absence of focused attention and without feature binding, allowing
        for change detection, but not localization or identification. We tested this
        hypothesis in three experiments, in which changes either involved colors that
        were already present elsewhere in the display or entirely unique colors. Observers
        detected whether any change had occurred and then localized or identified
        the change. Change detection without localization occurred almost exclusively
        when changes involved a unique color. Moreover, change detection without localization
        for unique feature changes was independent of the number of objects in the
        display and independent of change identification. These findings suggest that
        pre-attentive registration of a change on a feature map can give rise to a
        conscious experience even when feature binding has failed: that something
        has changed without knowing what or where.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13277-015-4037-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13277-015-4037-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13277-015-4037-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13277-015-4037-3\"}],\"title\":\"Development

        overweight and obese pediatric ( n \_=\_20) and adult ( n \_=\_9) subjects
        (23 male, 6 female) underwent three same-day 3T MR examinations. In each examination
        MRI-M, MRI-C, and single-voxel MRS were acquired three times. For each MRI
        acquisition, hepatic PDFF was estimated at the MRS voxel location. Intra-
        and inter-examination repeatability were assessed by computing standard deviations
        (SDs) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Aggregate SD was computed
        for each method as the square root of the average of first repeat variances.
        MRI-M and MRI-C PDFF estimation accuracy was assessed using linear regression
        with MRS as a reference.ResultsFor MRI-M, MRI-C, and MRS acquisitions, respectively,
        mean intra-examination SDs were 0.25%, 0.42%, and 0.49%; mean intra-examination
        ICCs were 0.999, 0.997, and 0.995; mean inter-examination SDs were 0.42%,
        0.45%, and 0.46%; and inter-examination ICCs were 0.995, 0.992, and 0.990.
        Aggregate SD for each method was \\u003c0.9%. Using MRS as a reference, regression
        slope, intercept, average bias, and R ^2, respectively, for MRI-M were 0.99%,
        1.73%, 1.61%, and 0.986, and for MRI-C were 0.96%, 0.43%, 0.40%, and 0.991.ConclusionMRI-M,
        MRI-C, and MRS showed high intra- and inter-examination hepatic PDFF estimation
        repeatability in overweight and obese subjects. Longitudinal hepatic PDFF
        change \\u003e1.8% (twice the maximum aggregate SD) may represent real change
        rather than measurement imprecision. Further research is needed to assess
        whether examinations performed on different days or with different MR technologists
        affect repeatability of MRS voxel placement and MRS-based PDFF measurements.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s15010-015-0840-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s15010-015-0840-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s15010-015-0840-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s15010-015-0840-4\"}],\"title\":\"Pulmonary

        was to evaluate the effect of liver diseases of different etiologies and clinical
        severity of liver cirrhosis on the serum level of hyaluronic acid. The results
        were compared with noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis: APRI, GAPRI, HAPRI,
        FIB-4 and Forn\u2019s index. Serum samples were obtained from 20 healthy volunteers
        and patients suffering from alcoholic cirrhosis (AC)\u201457 patients, non-alcoholic
        cirrhosis (NAC)\u201430 and toxic hepatitis (HT)\u201422. Cirrhotic patients
        were classified according to Child\u2013Pugh score. Hyaluronic acid concentration
        was measured by the immunochemical method. Non-patented indicators were calculated
        using special formulas. The mean serum hyaluronic acid concentration was significantly
        higher in AC, NAC and HT group in comparison with the control group. There
        were significant differences in the serum hyaluronic acid levels between liver
        diseases, and in AC they were significantly higher than those in NAC and HT
        group. The serum hyaluronic acid level differs significantly due to the severity
        of cirrhosis and was the highest in Child\u2013Pugh class C. The sensitivity,
        specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values and the area
        under the ROC curve for hyaluronic acid and all non-patented algorithms were
        high and similar to each other. We conclude that the concentration of hyaluronic
        acid changes in liver diseases and is affected by the severity of liver cirrhosis.
        Serum hyaluronic acid should be considered as a good marker for noninvasive
        diagnosis of liver damage, but the combination of markers is more useful.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00500-015-1867-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00500-015-1867-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00500-015-1867-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-015-1867-2\"}],\"title\":\"Efficient

        queries, which retrieve k data items with the best score, have been receiving
        considerable attention because they can support many real life applications.
        In this paper, we propose an efficient query routing scheme in mobile ad hoc
        networks (MANETs), namely CTR. CTR enables top-k data retrieval by only necessary
        nodes by employing a new clustering framework for top-k query processing.
        In this framework, nodes holding high rank data items become ClusterHeads
        (CHs), and top-k queries are transmitted between CHs via gateway nodes which
        belong to multiple clusters. Each CH maintains a set of hop counts between
        itself and high rank data items, so that it can judge whether or not to transmit
        a query on the fly. We further propose a query routing method, CTR $$^{2}$$
        2 , which integrates the clustering framework of CTR and a data replication
        approach. CTR $$^{2}$$ 2 improves the performance by retrieving the top-k
        data from nearby nodes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed

        is a phenomenon common to most biological processes that we can measure and
        is a particular feature of blood pressure (BP). Variability causes concern
        for many physicians regarding its clinical meaning and potential impact on
        cardiovascular risk. In this review, we assess the role of different time
        periods of blood pressure variability (BPV) in cardiovascular risk stratification.
        We review the indices of BPV derived from ambulatory blood pressure measurement
        (ABPM), home blood pressure measurement (HBPM), or at the clinic setting with
        the intention of providing a clear message for clinical practice. BPV, either
        derived from ABPM or HBPM, does not consistently augment cardiovascular risk
        prediction over and beyond that of average BP, particularly in low-risk individuals.
        That said, it would seem that certain medications such as calcium channel
        blockers may have a beneficial effect on visit-to-visit BPV and perhaps reduce
        the associated cardiovascular risk. This highlights the benefits in using
        combination therapy which might couple a number of therapeutic benefits such
        as the reductions of mean blood pressure and BPV. Overall, we should remain
        aware that the average BP level remains the main modifiable risk factor derived
        from BP measurements and continue to improve the control of hypertension and
        adverse health outcomes.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10916-015-0334-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10916-015-0334-z\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10916-015-0334-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10916-015-0334-z\"}],\"title\":\"Automatic

        fecal erythrocyte detection is performed via a manual operation that is unsuitable
        because it depends significantly on the expertise of individual inspectors.
        To recognize human erythrocytes automatically and precisely, automatic segmentation
        is very important for extraction of characteristics. In addition, multiple
        recognition algorithms are also essential. This paper proposes an algorithm
        based on morphological segmentation and a fuzzy neural network. The morphological
        segmentation process comprises three operational steps: top-hat transformation,
        Otsu\u2019s method, and image binarization. Following initial screening by
        area and circularity, fuzzy c-means clustering and the neural network algorithms
        are used for secondary screening. Subsequently, the erythrocytes are screened
        by combining the results of five images obtained at different focal lengths.
        Experimental results show that even when the illumination, noise pollution,
        and position of the erythrocytes are different, they are all segmented and
        labeled accurately by the proposed method. Thus, the proposed method is robust

        In this study, impacts of norspermidine on biofilm control and existing biofilm
        dispersal by a mixed culture from wastewater treatment systems were investigated.
        A surface-mediated releasing approach for prevention of bacterial biofilm
        formation was established via encapsulating norspermidine into polyelectrolyte
        multilayer coatings. Results showed that the presence of norspermidine (500\u20131000\_\u03BCM)
        in medium remarkably prevented biofilm formation. Norspermidine was also effective
        in disassembling pre-formed biofilms. Norspermidine-containing multilayer
        coatings were successfully fabricated on glass slides via layer-by-layer deposition
        in polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) solution. This coating
        exhibited a high anti-biofilm property against a mixed culture and three pure
        strains ( Bacillus subtilis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Escherichia coli
        ). The loading amount and space distribution of norspermidine in the multilayer
        coating were key factors influencing its anti-biofilm efficacy. The polymer
        coating with norspermidine loaded in each bilayer (each-layer-type) exhibited
        better anti-biofilm efficacy than the bottom-type and the top-type coating,
        which showed a stable biofilm inhibition rate of about 60\_% even after 5-day

        Salix babylonica Linn, Platanus orientalis and Robinia pseudoacacia) grown
        in three different climate zones (arid, semiarid and humid regions) were investigated
        for their potential as soil amendments. The results show that ash content,
        K^+, Ca^2+, Mg^2+, CEC, Cl^\u2212, pH, and salinity are generally higher in
        the straw biochars (STR-BCs) than the hardwood biochars (HW-BCs). However,
        there is no significant distinction between the two categories of biochars
        in terms of surface acidity, surface basicity, TC, available phosphorus (A-P)
        or NH_4 ^+-N. The contents of K^+, Na^+, Ca^2+, Mg^2+, EC, Cl^\u2212 of all
        21 biochars increase in semi-arid and arid regions in comparison to humid
        regions, while ash content, TC, CEC, pH, surface acidity, surface basicity,
        A-P and NH_4 ^+-N show no correlation to the climate. From the perspective
        of K^+, CEC and the remediation of acidified soils, STR-BCs are preferable
        over HW-BCs as a soil amendment, while HW-BCs are more suitable than STR-BCs
        in soils with a saline problem. EC, Na^+ and Cl^\u2212 increase with the water
        stress of the climatic regions, and the high saline ions of biochar in the
        arid regions indicate that biochars produced from local biomass, especially
        from crop residues, are at a high risk of exacerbating soil salinization.
        The big difference in the critical chemical properties, such as the saline
        ions, stresses that biochar should be taken on a regional basis as well as
        a biomass basis, with the general assumption that whether biochar as a soil
        amendment is good or bad is groundless.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10912-015-9357-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10912-015-9357-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10912-015-9357-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10912-015-9357-1\"}],\"title\":\"When

        parathyroid hyperplasia (HPT), parathyroid glands within the cervical thymus
        are a cause for recurrence. As a result of differences in pathophysiology,
        variable practice patterns exist regarding performing bilateral cervical thymectomy
        (BCT) in primary hyperplasia versus hyperplasia from renal failure or familial
        disease. The objective of this study was to capture patients where thymic
        tissue was found with subtotal parathyroidectomy (PTX) and intended BCT, identify
        number of thymic supernumerary glands (SNGs), and determine overall cure rate.MethodsRetrospective
        review of patients with four-gland exploration and intended BCT for HPT from
        2000 to 2013 was performed. Identification of thymic tissue and SNGs were
        determined by operative/pathology reports. Univariate analysis identified
        differences in cure rate for patients undergoing subtotal PTX with or without
        BCT.ResultsThymic tissue was found in 52\_% of 328 primary HPT (19\_% unilateral,
        33\_% bilateral), 77\_% of 128 renal HPT (28\_% unilateral, 49\_% bilateral),
        and 100\_% of familial HPT (24\_% unilateral, 76\_% bilateral) patients. Nine
        percent of primary, 18\_% of renal, and 10\_% of familial HPT patients had
        SNGs within thymectomy specimens. Cure rates of primary HPT patients with
        BCT were 99\_% compared to 94\_% in subtotal PTX alone. Renal HPT cure rates
        were 94\_% with BCT compared to 89\_% without BCT.ConclusionsRenal HPT patients
        benefited most in cure when thymectomy was performed. Although the rate of
        SNGs found in primary HPT was lower than renal HPT, the cure rate mimicked
        the pattern in renal disease. Furthermore, the incidences of SNGs in primary
        and familial HPT were similar. On the basis of these data, we advocate that
        BCT be considered in primary HPT when thymic tissue is readily identified.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00163-015-0201-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00163-015-0201-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00163-015-0201-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00163-015-0201-4\"}],\"title\":\"Product

        in instellingen voor ggz en maatschappelijke opvang. Ook ontbreekt het aan
        een goede ketensamenwerking met betrekking tot deze problematiek. Binnen een
        samenwerkingsverband van de gemeente Utrecht, zorginstellingen en huisartsen
        is deze gebrekkige aandacht in de afgelopen tien jaar een belangrijk thema
        geweest, uiteindelijk (in 2012) resulterend in de Utrechtse Somatische Screeningslijst.
        Met deze screening wordt beoogd somatische gezondheidsproblemen vroegtijdig
        te signaleren. Daarmee kan een beter beeld gevormd worden van de gezondheid
        van de pati\xEBnten en kan de huisarts eerder worden ingeschakeld. De eerste
        afgenomen screenings laten zien dat veelvoorkomende klachten en aandoeningen
        bij deze pati\xEBnten zijn: ondergewicht, COPD- en andere longklachten, pijnklachten,
        epileptische aanvallen en huidaandoeningen. Veel pati\xEBnten dragen een gebitsprothese.
        De verpleegkundigen ervaren de screening als een positieve ontwikkeling binnen
        hun vakgebied. Er zijn echter ook knelpunten aan te merken. Besloten is de

        there was an absence of structural attention for physical health of psychiatric
        and substance dependent patients in mental health care settings. Besides,
        in the case of the presence of somatic health problems, care providers did
        not cooperate in an adequate manner. This lack of attention has been a relevant
        topic within an alliance of health care institutions, general practitioners,
        and the municipality of Utrecht within the past ten years. This alliance resulted
        in the Utrecht Somatic Screening List. The objective of this screening is
        the timely monitoring of somatic health problems, in order to form a good
        image of the patients\u2019 health status, and to involve the general practitioner
        in the treatment process. The first findings show that frequent complaints
        and disorders in these patients are: being underweight, COPD- and other lung
        related problems, epileptic seizures, and skin diseases. Many patients wear
        a dental prosthesis. Nurses experience the screening as a positive development
        for their profession. There are however bottlenecks as well. We decided to

        role analysis also serves practical purposes, such as reducing the structure
        of complex systems to relationships among roles rather than alters, and enabling

        presents a data-driven approach for the discovery of social roles in large

        discovers roles by the conditional triad censuses of user ego-networks, which
        is a promising tool because they capture the degree to which basic social

        xyli subsp. xyli ( Lxx ), the causal agent of ratoon stunting disease of sugarcane
        (RSD), is a major constraint to sugarcane production worldwide. In Nigeria,
        the presence of RSD has not been conclusively determined. This study investigated
        the presence or absence of RSD through surveys in 18 sugarcane growing states
        in Nigeria. Sugarcane plants or ratoon crops of 7\u201312\_months of age were
        randomly sampled, and a total of 1190 samples of sugarcane stem cuttings from
        76 cultivars were collected. The lowest four internodes were cut longitudinally
        into nodes, and examined internally for reddish comma-like discoloration.
        PCR was conducted on DNA extracted from sugarcane sap using Lxx -specific
        primers. Reddish comma-like internal symptoms of RSD were observed only in
        samples of cultivar Co510. None of the sugarcane samples, including those
        from Co510, yielded the 438\_bp band expected for PCR detection of Lxx . Immunofluorescence
        microscopy analyses performed at SASRI, South Africa, using sap from the collected
        sugarcane samples, also did not detect the bacterium. Thus, the presence of
        RSD of sugarcane in Nigeria was not confirmed, contrary to its reported presence
        in 1956. Strict quarantine procedures should be followed to prevent introduction
        of the pathogen into Nigeria.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00393-014-1487-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00393-014-1487-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00393-014-1487-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00393-014-1487-8\"}],\"title\":\"Biosimilars

        to the clinical development of biosimilars in inflammatory rheumatic conditions
        (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing

        Phoslock\xAE generally showed no effect on nitrogen species. Whereas calcium

        the commercially important enzymes having great potential in various industries
        especially in food industry. Pectinases accounts for 25\_% of global food
        enzymes produced and their market is increasing day by day. Therefore, the
        exploration of microorganism with novel characteristics has always been the
        focus of the research. Microorganism dwelling in unique habitat may possess
        unique characteristics. As such, a pectinase producing fungus Aspergillus
        niger strain MCAS2 was isolated from soil of Manaslu Conservation Area (MCA),
        Gorkha, Nepal. The optimum production of pectinase enzyme was observed at
        48\_h of fermentation. The pectinase enzyme was partially purified by cold
        acetone treatment followed by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration chromatography.
        The partially purified enzyme exhibited maximum activity 60\_U/mg which was
        almost 8.5-fold higher than the crude pectinase. The approximate molecular
        weight of the enzyme was found to be 66\_kDa as observed from SDS-PAGE. The
        pectinase enzyme was active at broad range of temperature (30\u201370\_\xB0C)

        thermostable and alkaline nature of this pectinase can meet the demand of

        life-history features are expected to co-vary along environmental gradients
        related to changes in the vegetation structure or composition; however the
        direction and intensity should vary across regions at the large scale. This
        study focuses on the butterfly communities of Portuguese \u2018montados\u2019.
        Sixteen sites (mostly cork oak fields) were selected, reflecting a succession
        gradient in the vegetation of the understorey after human intervention. While
        controlling for vegetation and broader geographical and climate effects, we
        looked for trends in butterfly species richness and abundance (using generalised
        linear models) and for trends in species composition (using redundancy analyses).
        Moreover, we tried to uncover the co-variation between the butterfly life-history
        characteristics and succession. The results revealed that butterfly species
        richness was not significantly influenced by any of the considered variables.
        In contrast, abundance depended on geographic and oceanity\u2013continentality
        gradients as it increased towards the East and with more marked temperature
        annual ranges and less dry summer conditions. Species composition was influenced
        by temperature ranges and by shrub coverage. There was no strong evidence
        in favour of fast\u2013slow or generalist\u2013specialist syndromes co-varying
        along human imposed environmental gradients. However, after controlling for
        the broad scale variables (geography and climate) shrub cover emerged as a

        In the current study, we further investigated SG formation in human epithelial

        infiltration is one of the most important triggers of landslides. Vegetation
        is an effective way to mitigate water infiltration, reduce soil surface cracking,
        and, consequently, prevent landslides. In recent years, a soil mixture has
        been successfully used to grow vegetation on steep soil/rock surfaces by hydroseeding
        or shotcreting. The mixture contains seven ingredients, namely cement, fiber,
        peat, water retention agent, soil conditioner, soil, and pH adjusting agent.
        This study includes a germination and growth field test and a series of lab
        shear strength tests to assess: (1) the influence of the mixture\u2019s ingredients
        on germination and growth of the vegetation and (2) the effect of cement and
        fiber on the shear strength of the cured mixture. For the germination and
        growth test, the Taguchi method was utilized to determine the content of each
        ingredient (i.e., the percentage of each ingredient) used to prepare different
        mixtures. Cynodon dactylon was planted in different mixtures and the germination
        and growth had been monitored for 3\_months. The results indicated that the
        cement content had a significant influence on germination whereas the content
        of peat, soil conditioner, fiber, and water retention agent had a medium to
        negligible influence on germination. The content of all the ingredients had
        an influence on the plant\u2019s growth and the influence of the cement content
        was the greatest. When the cement content is higher than 10\_%, the growth
        of the plant is greatly hindered; therefore, to ensure a reasonable growth
        in the field, the cement content should be less than 10\_%. The shear strength
        tests used the sample prepared with different contents of cement and fiber,
        but the same porosity. The results showed that the contents of cement and
        fiber had a negligible influence on the friction angle, and the cohesion increased
        with the increase of cement content or decrease of the fiber content. Curing
        time of 7\u201314\_days yielded the maximal cohesion.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11999-015-4455-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11999-015-4455-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11999-015-4455-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11999-015-4455-y\"}],\"title\":\"\\n

        the impact of memory hierarchies on time-energy trade-off in parallel computations.
        Contemporary computing systems have deep memory hierarchies with significantly
        different speeds and power consumptions. This results in nonlinear phenomena
        in the processing time and energy usage emerging when the size of the computation
        is growing. In this paper the nonlinear dependence of the time and energy
        on the size of the solved problem is formalized and verified using measurements
        in practical computer systems. Then it is applied to formulate a problem of
        minimum time and minimum energy scheduling parallel processing of divisible
        loads. Divisible load theory is a scheduling and performance model of data-parallel
        applications. Mathematical programming is exploited to solve the scheduling
        problem. A trade-off between energy and schedule length is analyzed and again
        nonlinear relationships between these two criteria are observed. Further performance
        analysis reveals that energy consumption and schedule length are ruled by
        a complex interplay between the costs and speeds of on-core and out-of-core
        computations, communication delays, and activating new machines.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10551-015-2839-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10551-015-2839-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10551-015-2839-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-015-2839-2\"}],\"title\":\"Formation

        levels of stakeholder trust in business are of concern to business executives

        the role of personal values as one significant influence in trust formation

        the ball-catching task is that it allows researchers to manipulate the cost

        predictions on effort provision. In an experiment with piece-rate incentives

        are remarkably accurate. We also present experimental findings from three
        classic experiments, namely, team production, gift exchange and tournament,

        rise to cells that synthesize bone, cementum and fibrous connective tissue.

        objective of this study is to compare the antioxidant activity of a whole-grape
        suspension with the antioxidant activity or pure resveratrol on the effect

        acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, calcium ATPase activity, and sarcoendoplasmic
        reticular ATPase (SERCA) of the male rabbit urinary bladder. MDA was used
        as a model for the effect of H_2O_2 on lipid peroxidation. ChAT, SERCA, and
        calcium ATPase were evaluated based on their importance in urinary bladder
        physiology and pathology. Four male rabbit bladders were used. Each bladder
        was separated into muscle and mucosa, frozen under liquid nitrogen and stored
        at \u221280\_\xB0C for biochemical evaluation. The effect of H_2O_2 on the
        enzymes listed above was determined in the presence and absence of either
        resveratrol or a whole-grape suspension. (1) Resveratrol was significantly
        more effective than the grape suspension at protecting the bladder muscle
        and mucosa against peroxidation as quantitated by MDA formation. (2) The grape
        suspension was significantly more effective at protecting ChAT activity against
        oxidative stress of the muscle than resveratrol. (3) Neither the grape suspension
        nor resveratrol were particularly effective at protecting the bladder muscle
        or mucosa calcium ATPase or SERCA against oxidative stress. (4) ChAT was significantly
        more sensitive to oxidative stress than either calcium ATPase or SERCA. These
        data support the idea that the grape suspension protects the mitochondria
        and nerve terminals to a significantly greater degree than resveratrol which
        suggests that the activities of the grape suspension are due to the combination

        South Wales (NSW), located in the southeast of the Australian continent, is
        known to be influenced by four major climate drivers: the El Ni\xF1o/Southern
        Oscillation (ENSO), the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), the Southern
        Annular Mode (SAM) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Many studies have shown
        the influences of ENSO, IPO modulation, SAM and IOD on rainfall in Australia
        and on southeast Australia in particular. However, only limited work has been
        undertaken using a multiple regression framework to examine the extent of
        the combined effect of these climate drivers on rainfall. This paper analysed
        the role of these combined climate drivers and their interaction on the rainfall
        in NSW using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to account for model uncertainty
        by considering each of the linear models across the whole model space which
        is equal to the set of all possible combinations of predictors to find the
        model posterior probabilities and their expected predictor coefficients. Using
        BMA for linear regression models, we are able to corroborate and confirm the
        results from many previous studies. In addition, the method gives the ranking
        order of importance and the probability of the association of each of the
        climate drivers and their interaction on the rainfall at a site. The ability
        to quantify the relative contribution of the climate drivers offers the key
        to understand the complex interaction of drivers on rainfall, or lack of rainfall
        in a region, such as the three big droughts in southeastern Australia which
        have been the subject of discussion and debate recently on their causes.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10269-015-2541-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10269-015-2541-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10269-015-2541-4\"}],\"title\":\"Br\xE8ves

        both meniscal/ligamentous injury (MLI)-induced OA rat model and the clinical
        human OA cartilage tissues. Sam68 expression in chondrocytes under tumor necrosis
        factor-alpha (TNF-\u03B1) stimuli was also assessed by immunoblot. Inhibiting
        Sam68 in chondrocytes under TNF-\u03B1 stimuli was conducted using small interfering
        RNA (siRNA) and its influence on the expression of apoptotic marker and catabolic
        genes was examined by immunoblot. The mechanism of how Sam68 stimulates NF-\u03BAB
        activity was determined by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis
        of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of TNF-\u03B1-treated chondrocytes for

        I\u03BA-B degradation and p65 nuclear transportation in TNF-\u03B1-treated
        chondrocytes, indicating a suppressed NF-\u03BAB activation. Upon TNF-\u03B1

        disease remains the leading cause of mortality in type 2 diabetes, yet few
        strategies to target cardiac dysfunction have been developed. This randomised
        controlled trial aimed to investigate high intensity intermittent training
        (HIIT) as a potential therapy to improve cardiac structure and function in
        type 2 diabetes. The impact of HIIT on liver fat and metabolic control was
        also investigated.MethodsUsing an online random allocation sequence, 28 patients
        with type 2 diabetes (metformin and diet controlled) were randomised to 12\_weeks
        of HIIT ( n \u2009=\u200914) or standard care ( n \u2009=\u200914). Cardiac
        structure and function were measured by 3.0\_T MRI and tagging. Liver fat
        was determined by ^1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and glucose control
        by an OGTT. MRI analysis was performed by an observer blinded to group allocation.
        All study procedures took place in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.ResultsFive patients
        did not complete the study and were therefore excluded from analysis: this
        left 12 HIIT and 11 control patients for the intention-to-treat analysis.

        belief of many orthodontists that premolar extraction therapy leads to a loss
        of vertical dimension and an aggravated facial profile often predetermines
        a non-extraction approach. We investigated the short-term effects of systematic
        premolar extraction in borderline cases for extraction therapy on dentofacial
        parameters, especially vertical dimension and facial profile.Materials and
        methodsOf 50 juvenile borderline cases for extraction treatment with a distinct
        sagittal overjet of 6\u20139\_mm and dental crowding of \\u003e6\_mm, 25 had
        all first premolars extracted, whereas the 25 control patients received non-extraction
        orthodontic treatment with corresponding fixed and removable appliances. Patient
        selection by multivariate cluster analysis ensured homogeneity at baseline
        regarding dentoskeletal parameters. Parameter changes were determined with
        radiographic cephalograms and compared between the extraction and non-extraction
        group.ResultsThe systematic extraction of premolars in borderline patients
        with a distinct sagittal overjet and crowding did not significantly influence
        sagittal or vertical skeletal dimension, while leading to a slightly more
        concave lip profile due to incisor retraction compared to the non-extraction
        control group.ConclusionsThe influence of premolar extractions on facial profile
        is often overestimated, since only slight changes in lip profile are to be
        expected. In integrated treatment planning, the extraction decision should
        not be primarily based on concerns about the aggravation of facial profile
        and loss of vertical dimension.Clinicial relevanceThe decision, whether to
        extract healthy premolars in borderline patients for extraction therapy, is
        difficult to make. Our study clarifies the repercussions on cephalometric

        study was designed as a single-center prospective trial on 70 heart recipients,
        all 50\_years old or younger between March 2012 and June 2014 at the Imam
        Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran University. In recipients showing any evidence
        of heart failure or even asymptomatic recipients with high serum level of
        NT-proBNP (\u2265450\_pg/ml under age 50) or decreased LVEF, an endomyocardial

        Cancer 1 (Dlc1) is a tumor suppressor gene, which maps to human chromosome
        8p21-22 and is found frequently deleted in many cancers including breast cancer.
        The promoter of the remaining allele is often found methylated. The Dlc1 gene
        encodes a RhoGAP protein that regulates cell proliferation, migration and
        inhibits cell growth and invasion when restored in Dlc1 deficient tumor cell
        lines. This study focuses on determining the role of Dlc1 in normal mammary
        gland development and epithelial cell polarity in a Dlc1 gene trapped (gt)
        mouse.MethodsMammary gland whole mount preparations from 10-week virgin heterozygous
        Dlc1^gt/+ gene-trapped mice were compared with age-matched wild type (WT)
        controls. Hematoxylin-Eosin (H\\u0026E) and Masson\u2019s Trichrome staining
        of histological sections were carried out. Mammary glands from Dlc1^gt/+ mice
        and WT controls were enzymatically digested with collagenase and dispase and
        then cultured overnight to deplete hematopoietic and endothelial cells. The
        single cell suspensions were then cultured in Matrigel for 12\_days. To knockdown
        Dlc1 expression, primary WT mammary epithelial cells were infected with short
        hairpin (sh) RNA expressing lentivirus or with a scrambled shRNA control.ResultsDlc1^gt/+
        mice showed anomalies in the mammary gland that included increased ductal
        branching and deformities in terminal end buds and branch points. Compared
        to the WT controls, Masson\u2019s Trichrome staining showed a thickened stromal
        layer with increased collagen deposition in mammary glands from Dlc1^gt/+
        mice. Dlc1^gt/+ primary mammary epithelial cells formed increased solid acinar
        spheres in contrast with WT and scrambled shRNA control cells, which mostly
        formed hollow acinar structures when plated in 3D Matrigel cultures. These
        solid acinar structures were similar to the acinar structures formed when
        Dlc1 gene expression was knocked down in WT mammary cells by shRNA lentiviral
        transduction. The solid acinar structures were not due to a defect in apoptosis
        as determined by a lack of detectible cleaved caspase 3 antibody staining.
        Primary mammary cells from Dlc1^gt/+ mice showed increased RhoA activity compared
        with WT cells.ConclusionsThe results illustrate that decreased Dlc1 expression

        The Author(s)\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractIn cognitive neuroscience,
        electrical brain activity is most commonly recorded at the scalp. In order
        to infer the contributions and connectivity of underlying neuronal sources
        within the brain, it is necessary to reconstruct sensor data at the source
        level. Several approaches to this reconstruction have been developed, thereby
        solving the so-called implicit inverse problem Michel et al. (Clin Neurophysiol
        115:2195\u20132222, 2004 ). However, a unifying premise against which to validate
        these source reconstructions is seldom available. The dataset provided in
        this work, in which brain activity is simultaneously recorded on the scalp
        (non-invasively) by electroencephalography (EEG) and on the cortex (invasively)
        by electrocorticography (ECoG), can be of a great help in this direction.
        These multimodal recordings were obtained from a macaque monkey under wakefulness
        and sedation. Our primary goal was to establish the connectivity architecture
        between two sources of interest (frontal and parietal), and to assess how
        their coupling changes over the conditions. We chose these sources because
        previous studies have shown that the connections between them are modified
        by anaesthesia Boly et al. (J Neurosci 32:7082\u20137090, 2012 ). Our secondary
        goal was to evaluate the consistency of the connectivity results when analyzing
        sources recorded from invasive data (128 implanted ECoG sources) and source
        activity reconstructed from scalp recordings (19 EEG sensors) at the same
        locations as the ECoG sources. We conclude that the directed connectivity
        in the frequency domain between cortical sources reconstructed from scalp
        EEG is qualitatively similar to the connectivity inferred directly from cortical
        recordings, using both data-driven (directed transfer function) and biologically
        grounded (dynamic causal modelling) methods. Furthermore, the connectivity
        changes identified were consistent with previous findings Boly et al. (J Neurosci
        32:7082\u20137090, 2012 ). Our findings suggest that inferences about directed
        connectivity based upon non-invasive electrophysiological data have construct
        validity in relation to invasive recordings.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10980-015-0268-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10980-015-0268-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10980-015-0268-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-015-0268-3\"}],\"title\":\"Fire

        increase in the incidence of large wildfires worldwide has prompted concerns
        about the resilience of forest ecosystems, particularly in the western U.S.,
        where recent changes are linked with climate warming and 20th-century land
        management practices.ObjectivesTo study forest resilience to recent wildfires,
        we examined relationships among fire legacies, landscape features, ecological
        conditions, and patterns of post-fire conifer regeneration.MethodsWe quantified
        regeneration across 182 sites in 21 recent large fires\_in dry mixed-conifer\_forests

        to predict the probability of establishment and abundance of conifers 5\u201313\_years
        post-fire.ResultsSeedling densities varied widely across all sites (0\u2013127,500
        seedlings ha^\u22121) and were best explained by variability in distance to
        live seed sources (\u03B2\_=\_\u22120.014, p\_=\_0.002) and pre-fire tree
        basal area (\u03B2\_=\_0.072, p\_=\_0.008). Beyond 95\_m from the nearest
        live seed source, the probability of seedling establishment was low. Across
        all the fires we studied, 75\_% of the burned area with high tree mortality
        was within this 95-m threshold, suggesting the presence of live seed trees
        to facilitate natural regeneration. \_ConclusionsCombined with the mix of
        species present within the burn mosaic,\_dry mixed-conifer forests will be
        resilient to large fires across our study region, provided that seedlings

        is a method utilized to protect flexible electroluminescence device against

        unknown. The variability, perceived in DNA repair genes, may be of clinical
        importance for evaluation of the risk of occurrence of a given type of cancer,
        its prophylactics and therapy. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship
        between gene polymorphism R156R (C to A, rs238406) of ERCC2 gene and modulation
        of the risk of endometrial cancer in Poland. Our research included 1360 patients
        with EC and 1320 healthy controls. The genotype analysis of ERCC2 gene polymorphism
        was performed using the PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism
        (PCR-RFLP). In the presented study, a relationship was identified between
        R156R polymorphism of the ERCC2 gene and the incidence of endometrial cancer.
        An association was observed between EC occurrence and the presence of A/A

        provides the possibility for interactive visits to historic buildings and

        realistic virtual environments, by concentrating on the visual component.
        However, by incorporating more authentic acoustical properties into visual
        models, a more realistic rendering of the studied venue is achieved. In historic
        auralizations, calibration of the studied building\u2019s room acoustic simulation
        model is often necessary to come to a realistic representation of its acoustical
        environment. This paper presents a methodical calibration procedure for geometrical
        acoustics models using room acoustics prediction programs based on geometrical
        acoustics to create realistic virtual audio realities, or auralizations. To
        develop this procedure, a small unfinished amphitheater was first chosen due
        to its general simplicity and considerable level of reverberation. A geometrical
        acoustics model was calibrated according to the results of acoustical measurements.
        Measures employed during the calibration of this model were analyzed to come
        to a methodical calibration procedure. The developed procedure was then applied
        to a more complex building, the abbey church Saint-Germain-des-Pr\xE9s. A
        possible application of the presented procedure is to enable interactive acoustical
        visits of former configurations of buildings. A test case study was carried

        This non-inferiority study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3-monthly
        goserelin 10.8\_mg compared with monthly goserelin 3.6\_mg.MethodsThis was
        a Phase 3, open-label, multicenter trial. Pre-menopausal women with ER-positive
        advanced breast cancer were randomized to 3-monthly goserelin 10.8\_mg or
        monthly goserelin 3.6\_mg; all patients received concomitant tamoxifen (20\_mg
        daily). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24\_weeks;
        non-inferiority was to be confirmed if the entire 95\_% confidence interval
        (CI) for the treatment difference was above \u221217.5\_%. Secondary endpoints
        included objective response rate (ORR), serum E2 levels, safety, and tolerability.ResultsIn
        total, 222 patients were randomized (goserelin 10.8\_mg, n \_=\_109; goserelin
        3.6\_mg, n \_=\_113). PFS rate at week 24 was 61.5\_% (goserelin 10.8\_mg)
        and 60.2\_% (goserelin 3.6\_mg); treatment difference (95\_% CI) was 1.3\_%
        (\u221211.4, 13.9), confirming non-inferiority of goserelin 10.8\_mg compared
        with goserelin 3.6\_mg. ORR was 23.9\_% (goserelin 10.8\_mg) and 26.9\_% (goserelin
        3.6\_mg); treatment difference (95\_% CI) was \u22123.0\_% (\u221215.5, 9.7).
        At week 24, mean serum E2 concentrations were similar in the goserelin 10.8\_mg
        and goserelin 3.6\_mg groups (20.3\_pg/mL and 24.8\_pg/mL, respectively).ConclusionA
        regimen of 3-monthly goserelin 10.8\_mg demonstrated non-inferiority compared
        with monthly goserelin 3.6\_mg for PFS rate at 24\_weeks, with similar pharmacodynamic
        and safety profiles, in pre-menopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.7603/s40706-015-0003-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.7603/s40706-015-0003-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7603/s40706-015-0003-8\"}],\"title\":\"Interfirm

        Prevention Initiative in the Spinal Cord Injury Centers\u201D were released
        in July 2008 in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System. The purpose
        of this study was to use the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in
        Health Systems (PARiHS) framework to evaluate the experiences of implementation
        of SCI/D MRSA prevention guidelines in VA SCI/D Centers approximately 2\u20133\_years
        after the guidelines were released.MethodsMixed methods were used across two
        phases in this study. The first phase included an anonymous, web-based cross-sectional
        survey administered to providers at all 24 VA SCI/D Centers. The second phase
        included semi-structured telephone interviews with providers at 9 SCI/D Centers.
        The PARiHS framework was used as the foundation of both the survey questions
        and semi-structured interview guide.ResultsThe survey was completed by 295
        SCI/D providers (43.8\_% response rate) from 22 of the 24 SCI/D Centers (91.7\_%
        participation rate). Respondents included nurses (57.3\_%), therapists (24.4\_%),
        physicians (11.1\_%), physician assistants (3.4\_%), and other health care
        professionals (3.8\_%). Approximately 36\_% of the SCI/D providers surveyed
        had not seen, did not remember seeing, or had never heard of the MRSA SCI/D
        guidelines, whereas 42.3\_% of providers reported that the MRSA SCI/D guidelines
        were fully implemented in their SCI/D Center. Data revealed numerous barriers
        and facilitators to guideline implementation. Facilitators included enhanced
        leadership support and provider education, focused guideline dissemination
        to reach SCI/D providers, and strong perceived evidence supporting the guidelines.
        Barriers included lack of awareness of the guidelines among physical therapists
        and physician assistants and challenges in cohorting/isolating MRSA-positive
        patients and following contact precautions.ConclusionsSuccessful implementation
        of MRSA infection prevention guidelines in SCI/D settings requires (1) guideline
        dissemination that reaches the full range of SCI/D providers working in inpatient,
        outpatient, and other care settings, (2) provider education that is frequent
        and systematic, (3) strong leadership support, and (4) that barriers unique
        to the recommendations are addressed. These findings may be used to inform
        selection of implementation strategies and optimize infection prevention beyond
        MRSA as well as in other specialty care populations.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3587-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3587-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3587-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3587-2\"}],\"title\":\"Towards

        inflatum is the causal agent of Pythium maize stalk rot, which is one of the
        most devastating diseases of maize ( Zea mays L.). P. inflatum is currently
        a major concern in global maize production. To the best of our knowledge,
        no effective resistance to P. inflatum is known in maize, and no effective
        measures have been reported for the control of this pathogen once maize plants
        have been infected. Early and accurate detection of P. inflatum is essential
        to guide maize planting and to protect maize production. A real-time fluorescence
        loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp) assay was developed for the
        rapid quantitative detection of P. inflatum in soil. The detection limit of
        the RealAmp assay was approximately 0.1\_pg/\u03BCl plasmid DNA when mixed
        with extracted soil DNA or 10^3 spores/g of artificially infested soil. No
        cross-reactions with other related pathogens were observed. Results of the
        RealAmp assay for quantifying the genomic DNA of P. inflatum were confirmed
        by testing with artificially and naturally infested samples. The quantification
        of the soil-borne pathogen DNA of P. inflatum in naturally infested samples
        was not significantly different compared with classic real-time PCR ( P \u2009\\u003c\u20090.05).
        Additionally, the RealAmp assay could be detected via an improved closed-tube
        visual detection system by adding SYBR Green I fluorescent dye to the inside
        of the lid prior to amplification. Consequently, the inhibitory effects of
        the stain on DNA amplification were avoided. Therefore, the assay could be
        used more conveniently in the field as a simple, rapid, and effective technique
        and has the potential to become an alternative tool for detecting and monitoring
        P. inflatum in the field.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11325-015-1249-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11325-015-1249-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11325-015-1249-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11325-015-1249-0\"}],\"title\":\"Association

        In societal approaches to the mitigation of major disease \u2018burden\u2019,
        population screening can sometimes provide an effective approach to improving
        detection of disease and outcomes. However the acceptability of a systematic
        population screening programme for dementia, to the British public, is not
        known.MethodsA Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) event was organised to
        give members of the public from the East of England an opportunity to offer
        their perspectives and to comment on the findings of a systematic literature
        review looking at attitudes and preferences towards screening for dementia.
        The event was attended by 36 members of the public and eight national Alzheimer\u2019s
        Society Research Network volunteers. The morning discussion contained a presentation,
        which defined population screening for attendees but contained no reference
        to the findings of the review. In the afternoon, findings of the review were
        presented and a discussion on the results was facilitated. The discussions
        were recorded, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. The NVivo qualitative
        data software was used to facilitate this process.ResultsA total of 23 key
        themes emerged in relation to the carer and general population. The most frequent
        themes which emerged were the low levels of understanding and awareness around
        the dementia syndrome; the acceptability and validity of any tests; costs
        to the National Health Service (NHS); an individual\u2019s existing health
        status existing health status; financial/profit motive for screening; the
        inability to change prognosis; and the importance and availability of support.ConclusionsFactors
        such as personal beliefs, experiences and attitudes to health impact on decisions
        to be screened for dementia. A number of additional concerns were raised which
        were not previously identified in the systematic literature review. These
        were around the economic incentives for screening (profit motive), the provision
        of social support, and the economic/social impacts of screening programmes.
        This may reflect cultural differences in health and social care funding models

        importance of food fibers has led to the development of a large and potential
        market for fiber-enriched foods, and nowadays, there is an ongoing interest
        to find new sources of dietary fiber (DF), such as agroindustrial coproducts
        which have traditionally been undervalued. The aim of the article was to evaluate
        the suitability of five sources of DF to develop fiber-enriched foods. Proximate
        analysis and physicochemical, technological, and physiological properties
        (including cholesterol absorption capacity) of these DF sources were determined
        and compared. Not only proximate composition but also physicochemical and
        techno-functional properties of DF samples depend on the composition of the
        raw material (pomegranate, citrus, tiger nuts\u2026), the industrial source,
        and the coproducts processing into DF extracts. Total dietary fiber content
        and the ratio insoluble/soluble dietary fiber determine the values obtained
        for these properties. However, cholesterol adsorption capacity seems to be
        influenced for other components linked to dietary fiber. Extracts rich in
        DF obtained from agroindustrial coproducts can be used as functional ingredients.

        portable X-ray fluorescence (FPXRF) technology can offer a rapid and cost-effective
        determination of the total elemental concentrations in soils. The aims of
        this study were (i) to test the capability of FPXRF to predict the element
        concentrations of a very large soil sample set and (ii) to assess the influence
        of soil moisture, known to strongly affect the quality of FPXRF analyses.Materials
        and methodsA large set of 215 soil samples were analysed for Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu,
        Fe, Mn, Pb, Rb, Sn, Sr and Zn by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
        spectroscopy (ICPAES) after aqua regia digestion and with a FPXRF analyser
        using a short acquisition time. Soil samples were then saturated with ultrapure
        water to test the influence of soil water content on FPXRF signal.Results
        and discussionFor all of the elements, the total concentrations obtained with
        ICPAES and FPXRF showed a very high degree of linearity, indicating that FPXRF
        can effectively predict element concentrations in soils. A Lambert-Beer law
        was successfully used to describe the decrease in the FPXRF concentrations
        with increasing soil moisture. The attenuation coefficient obtained for each
        element allowed us to satisfactorily predict the FPXRF concentrations of samples
        for water contents as high as 136.8\_%.ConclusionsThese results show that
        the effect of water on signal attenuation can be corrected and that FPXRF
        may gradually replace chemical methods for the analysis of environmental samples.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12055-015-0403-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12055-015-0403-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12055-015-0403-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12055-015-0403-4\"}],\"title\":\"Isolated

        of damaged cartilage tissue, pluripotent stem cell-based therapies are being
        intensively explored. A number of techniques exist that enable monitoring
        of stem cell differentiation, including immunofluorescence staining. This
        simple and fast method enables changes to be observed during the differentiation
        process. Here, two protocols for the differentiation of human embryonic stem
        cells into chondrocytes were used (monolayer cell culture and embryoid body
        formation). Cells were labeled for markers expressed during the differentiation
        process at different time points (pluripotent: NANOG, SOX2, OCT3/4, E-cadherin;
        prochondrogenic: SOX6, SOX9, Collagen type II; extracellular matrix components:
        chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate; beta-catenin, CXCR4, and Brachyury).
        Comparison of the signal intensity of differentiated cells to control cell
        populations (articular cartilage chondrocytes and human embryonic stem cells)
        showed decreased signal intensities of pluripotent markers, E-cadherin and
        beta-catenin. Increased signal intensities of prochondrogenic markers and
        extracellular matrix components were observed. The changes during chondrogenic
        differentiation monitored by evaluation of pluripotent and chondrogenic markers
        signal intensity were described. The changes were similar to several studies
        over chondrogenesis. These results were confirmed by semi-quantitative analysis
        of IF signals. In this research we indicate a bioimaging as a useful tool
        to monitor and semi-quantify the IF pictures during the differentiation of

        was chemically modified by reacting it with dialkyl phosphites of varying
        alkyl structures under inert atmosphere in the presence of free radical initiators.
        The reaction gave a mixture of mono- and di-adduct products and was optimized
        to produce only the di-adduct product limonene bisphosphonate by forcing both
        limonene double bonds to react completely. The product mixture was carefully
        characterized using a combination of gas chromatography\u2013mass spectroscopy,
        infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (^1H, ^13C,
        ^31P). The bisphosphonates were investigated for their physical and tribological
        properties. The alkyl bisphosphonates displayed density and viscosity that
        was a function of the alkyl structure (methyl, ethyl, n -butyl) and much higher
        than the values for the unreacted limonene. They also displayed improved oxidation
        stability but lower viscosity index and solubility in polyalphaolefin (PAO6)
        and high-oleic sunflower oil (HOSuO) base oils. Tribological characterization
        of the neat modified oils on a four-ball tribometer showed improved extreme-pressure
        weld point by all three di-adducts and improved anti-wear coefficient of friction
        (COF) and wear scar diameter (WSD) by the n -butyl di-adduct only. The limonene
        bisphosphonates also displayed improved COF and WSD as additives in PAO6 and
        HOSuO base oils at low concentrations. The effects of chemical modifications
        on physical and tribological properties can be explained in terms of increased
        polarity of the modified products, insertion of heavy atoms (from PO_3) into
        the limonene structure, and complete absence of unsaturation in the modified

        model to examine migration, phagocytosis, and fibrin structure.Materials and
        methodsTHP-1 cell migration was measured in the presence and absence of zoledronate,
        ibandronate, risedronate, alendronate, pamidronate (0.5, 5 and 50\_\u03BCM)
        and clodronate (125, 250 and 500\_\u03BCM) using the real-time xCELLigence
        system. Phagocytosis and actin fibre assays were performed after 72\_h with
        zoledronate, ibandronate, alendronate and clodronate.ResultsTime to maximum

        for high dosages of zoledronate, ibandronate and alendronate compared to controls.
        All dosages of clodronate and a low dose of zoledronate exhibited prolonged
        migrations. Phagocytic capacity was significantly reduced in high dosages
        of all bisphosphonates and for 5\_\u03BCM zoledronate and ibandronate ( p
        \u2009\\u003c\u20090.05). Low bisphosphonate exposure was accompanied by overcharged
        phagosoms. Altered appearance in F-actin fibrin structure was observed in
        bisphosphonate-exposed cells.ConclusionsAll bisphosphonates altered the migration
        of THP-1 cells dose-dependently. Low doses also prolonged migration and altered

        aim of this paper is to reconcile two claims that have long been thought to
        be incompatible: (a) that we compositionally determine the meaning of complex
        expressions from the meaning of their parts, and (b) that prototypes are components
        of the meaning of lexical terms such as fish , red , and gun . Hypotheses
        (a) and (b) are independently plausible, but most researchers think that reconciling
        them is a difficult, if not hopeless task. In particular, most linguists and
        philosophers agree that (a) is not negotiable; so they tend to reject (b).
        Recently, there have been some attempts to reconcile these claims (Prinz,
        Furnishing the mind: concepts and their perceptual basis 2002 ; The Oxford
        handbook of compositionality 2012 ; J\xF6nsson and Hampton, Cognition 106:913\u2013923,
        2008 ; Hampton and J\xF6nsson, The Oxford handbook of compositionality 2012
        ; Schurz, The Oxford handbook of compositionality 2012 ), but they all adopt
        an implausibly weak notion of compositionality. Furthermore, parties to this
        debate tend to fall into a problematic way of individuating prototypes that
        is too externalistic. In contrast, I propose that we can reconcile (a) and
        (b) if we adopt, instead, an internalist and pluralist conception of prototypes

        airports are under increasing pressure to comply with the Eurocontrol collaborative
        decision making (CDM) initiative, to ensure that information is passed between
        stakeholders, integrate automated decision support or make predictions. These
        systems can also aid effective operations beyond the airport by communicating
        scheduling decisions to other relevant parties, such as Eurocontrol, for passing
        on to downstream airports and enabling overall airspace improvements. One
        of the major CDM components is aimed at producing the target take-off times
        and target startup-approval times, i.e. scheduling when the aircraft should
        push back from the gates and start their engines and when they will take off.
        For medium-sized airports, a common choice for this is a \u201Cpre-departure
        sequencer\u201D (PDS). In this paper, we describe the design and requirements
        challenges which arose during our development of a PDS system for medium sized
        international airports. Firstly, the scheduling problem is highly dynamic
        and event driven. Secondly, it is important to end-users that the system be
        predictable and, as far as possible, transparent in its operation, with decisions
        that can be explained. Thirdly, users can override decisions, and this information
        has to be taken into account. Finally, it is important that the system is
        as fair as possible for all users of the airport, and the interpretation of
        this is considered here. Together, these factors have influenced the design
        of the PDS system which has been built to work within an existing large system
        which is being used at many airports.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10157-015-1162-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10157-015-1162-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10157-015-1162-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10157-015-1162-7\"}],\"title\":\"Differentially

        report narrative contains a large amount of information about the patient\u2019s
        health and the radiologist\u2019s interpretation of medical findings. Most
        of this critical information is entered in free text format, even when structured
        radiology report templates are used. The radiology report narrative varies
        in use of terminology and language among different radiologists and organizations.
        The free text format and the subtlety and variations of natural language hinder
        the extraction of reusable information from radiology reports for decision
        support, quality improvement, and biomedical research. Therefore, as the first
        step to organize and extract the information content in a large multi-institutional
        free text radiology report repository, we have designed and developed an unsupervised
        machine learning approach to capture the main concepts in a radiology report
        repository and partition the reports based on their main foci. In this approach,
        radiology reports are modeled in a vector space and compared to each other
        through a cosine similarity measure. This similarity is used to cluster radiology
        reports and identify the repository\u2019s underlying topics. We applied our
        approach on a repository of 1,899,482 radiology reports from three major healthcare
        organizations. Our method identified 19 major radiology report topics in the
        repository and clustered the reports accordingly to these topics. Our results
        are verified by a domain expert radiologist and successfully explain the repository\u2019s

        paper examines a transfer pricing problem between two divisions of a decentralized

        within the firm. Unlike most previous work, we focus on dual transfer pricing
        systems that allow the selling division to be credited for an amount that
        differs from the amount charged to the buying division. We identify conditions

        will depend only on public information about the market price charged by the
        upstream division in the external market, which indirectly communicates information
        about production costs to the downstream division. For a variety of well-known

        is a chronic relapsing autoimmune disease characterized by production of autoantibodies
        against a series of nuclear antigens and by chronic inflammation. The etiology
        of SLE is the result of interactions between genetic, epigenetic, hormonal,
        and environmental factors. Changes in histone acetylation and methylation
        contribute to structural chromatin modifications.ObjectiveWe studied the histone
        demethylase JHDM1D and histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 transcript
        levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients diagnosed
        with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Furthermore, the association of JHDM1D,
        HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 transcript levels with gender, age, and major clinical
        manifestations were analyzed.Materials and methodsReal-time quantitative polymerase
        chain reaction (RQ-PCR) analysis was used to determine JHDM1D, HDAC1, HDAC2,
        and HDAC3 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
        from 30\_patients with SLE and 36\_healthy controls.ResultsSignificantly lower
        HDAC2 transcript levels (p\u2009=\u20090.006785) and significantly higher
        JHDM1D (p\u2009=\u20090.0000002) and HDAC1 (p\u2009=\u20090.010581) transcript
        levels in SLE patients were observed compared with healthy controls. Higher
        JHDM1D mRNA expression was detected in active SLE patients when compared with
        inactive patients (p\u2009=\u20090.005). Furthermore, the JHDM1D transcript
        levels were positively correlated with disease activity ( r _s =\u20090.368,
        p\u2009=\u20090.045), while HDAC2 mRNA expression was positively correlated
        with disease duration ( r _s =\u20090.502, p\u2009=\u20090.0047).ConclusionOur
        analyses confirmed the importance of epigenetic alterations (histone demethylation
        and acetylation) in SLE etiology. Moreover, our results suggest that the presence
        of some clinical manifestations, like hematological disease and anti-Ro antibody,
        might be associated with the dysregulation of histone demethylase and deacetylases

        the revised nomenclature, the new classification of disorders of sex development

        have undergone major changes in the approach of DSD. Based on these advances,
        this review is an update of the pathophysiology of DSD. Although the etiology
        of gonad dysgenesis has advanced considerably by sequencing of candidate genes,
        a majority remains without molecular diagnosis. In contrast, gene mutation
        analysis is highly successful in 46,XY DSD due to defects in biosynthesis
        and metabolism of testosterone. More than 95% of 46,XY DSD with complete female
        phenotype and normal testicular function are CAIS due to mutation of the androgen
        receptor gene. In contrast, the majority of the other 46,XY DSD are not PAIS.
        Recent advances of ovarian development and genetics of ovotestis provide new
        approach of 46,XX DSD. Some insights regarding 46,XX DSD are reviewed. The
        multidisciplinary approach for a better phenotypic assessment and the era
        of next generation sequencing should improve our understanding of the DSD.

        Breathe is an evidence-based curriculum designed to teach basic neonatal resuscitation
        in low-resource countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acquisition
        of knowledge and skills following this training and correlation of learner
        characteristics to performance in a Spanish-speaking setting.MethodsThirty-one
        physicians and 39 nurses completed Helping Babies Breathe training at a Honduran
        community hospital. Trainee knowledge and skills were evaluated before and
        after the training using a multiple-choice questionnaire, bag-mask ventilation
        skills test, and two objective structured clinical exams (OSCEs). Linear mixed-effects
        models were used to analyze assessment scores pre- and post-training by profession
        (physician or nurse) while controlling for covariates.ResultsHelping Babies
        Breathe training resulted in significant increases in mean scores for the
        multiple-choice question test, bag-mask ventilation skills test, and OSCE
        B. Time to initiation of effective bag-mask ventilation decreased from a mean
        of 74.8 to 68.4\_s. Despite this improvement in bag-mask ventilation, only
        42\u2009% of participants were able to initiate effective bag-mask ventilation
        within the Golden Minute. Although physicians scored higher on the pre-test
        multiple-choice questions and bag-mask ventilation, nurses demonstrated a
        greater mean difference in scores after training. OSCE B scores pre- and post-training
        increased similarly between professions. Nurses\u2019 and physicians\u2019
        performance in simulation was not significantly different after the training.
        Assessment scores and course feedback indicated a need for more skills practice,
        particularly with bag-mask ventilation.ConclusionsWhen evaluated immediately
        after an initial workshop, Helping Babies Breathe training resulted in significant
        gains in neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills. Following training,
        nurses, who commonly do not perform these skills in real-life situations,
        were able to perform at a similar level to physicians. Further studies are
        necessary to determine how to sustain this knowledge and skills over time,
        tailor the course to learner characteristics, and whether this training translates
        into improvements in clinical practice.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s12910-015-0052-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s12910-015-0052-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s12910-015-0052-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-015-0052-6\"}],\"title\":\"Informed

        ill and injured infants and children globally should be based on best research
        evidence to ensure safe, efficacious treatment. In South Africa and other
        low and middle-income countries, research is needed to optimise care and ensure
        rational, equitable allocation of scare paediatric critical care resources.
        Ethical oversight is essential for safe, appropriate research conduct. Informed
        consent by the parent or legal guardian is usually required for child research
        participation, but obtaining consent may be challenging in paediatric critical
        care research. Local regulations may also impede important research if overly
        restrictive. By narratively synthesising and contextualising the results of
        a comprehensive literature review, this paper describes ethical principles
        and regulations; potential barriers to obtaining prospective informed consent;
        and consent options in the context of paediatric critical care research in
        South Africa.DiscussionVoluntary prospective informed consent from a parent
        or legal guardian is a statutory requirement for child research participation
        in South Africa. However, parents of critically ill or injured children might
        be incapable of or unwilling to provide the level of consent required to uphold
        the ethical principle of autonomy. In emergency care research it may not be
        practical to obtain consent when urgent action is required. Therapeutic misconceptions
        and sociocultural and language issues are also barriers to obtaining valid
        consent. Alternative consent options for paediatric critical care research
        include a waiver or deferred consent for minimal risk and/or emergency research,
        whilst prospective informed consent is appropriate for randomised trials of
        novel therapies or devices.SummaryWe propose that parents or legal guardians
        of critically ill or injured children should only be approached to consent
        for their child\u2019s participation in clinical research when it is ethically
        justifiable and in the best interests of both child participant and parent.
        Where appropriate, alternatives to prospective informed consent should be
        considered to ensure that important paediatric critical care research can
        be undertaken in South Africa, whilst being cognisant of research risk. This
        document could provide a basis for debate on consent options in paediatric
        critical care research and contribute to efforts to advocate for South African

        safety culture was measured by the Hospital Survey of Patient Safety Culture
        (HSOPSC) developed by Westat. Adverse events were measured using the Global
        Trigger Tool (GTT), developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.
        GTT data was collected from patient records discharged May \u2013 August 2009
        and the HSOPSC data collected in 2010. Descriptive statistics were used to

        life events such as severe health status changes or intensive medical treatment
        often trigger response shifts in individuals that may hamper the comparison

        detecting response shift at the item level in psychosomatic inpatients and
        evaluating its impact on the validity of comparing repeated measurements.Study
        design and settingComplete pretest and posttest data were available from 1188
        patients who had filled out the ICD-10 Symptom Rating (ISR) scale at admission
        and discharge, on average 24\_days after intake. Reconceptualization, reprioritization,
        and recalibration response shifts were explored applying tests of measurement
        invariance. In the item-level approach, all model parameters were constrained
        to be equal between pretest and posttest. If non-invariance was detected,
        these were linked to the different types of response shift.ResultsWhen constraining
        across-occasion model parameters, model fit worsened as indicated by a significant
        Satorra\u2013Bentler Chi-square difference test suggesting potential presence
        of response shifts. A close examination revealed presence of two types of
        response shift, i.e., (non)uniform recalibration and both higher- and lower-level
        reconceptualization response shifts leading to four model adjustments.ConclusionsOur
        analyses suggest that psychosomatic inpatients experienced some response shifts
        during their hospital stay. According to the hierarchy of measurement invariance,
        however, only one of the detected non-invariances is critical for unbiased
        mean comparisons over time, which did not have a substantial impact on estimating
        change. Hence, the use of the ISR can be recommended for outcomes assessment
        in clinical routine, as change score estimates do not seem hampered by response
        shift effects.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10555-015-9595-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10555-015-9595-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10555-015-9595-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10555-015-9595-8\"}],\"title\":\"EPLIN:

        disease is of paramount importance in modern medicine. In 2012, it was estimated
        that 162,000 people died from cancer in the UK which illustrates a fundamental
        problem. Traditional treatments for cancer have various drawbacks, and this
        creates a considerable need for specific, molecular targets to overcome cancer
        spread. Epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN) is an actin-associated
        molecule which has been implicated in the development and progression of various
        cancers including breast, prostate, oesophageal and lung where EPLIN expression
        is frequently lost as the cancer progresses. EPLIN is important in the regulation
        of actin dynamics and has multiple associations at epithelial cells junctions.
        Thus, EPLIN loss in cancer may have significant effects on cancer cell migration
        and invasion, increasing metastatic potential. Overexpression of EPLIN has
        proved to be an effective tool for manipulating cancerous traits such as reducing
        cell growth and cell motility and rendering cells less invasive illustrating

        and hypothesisUnified staging systems for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) have
        been established. We examined the application of the POP quantification (POP-Q)
        system in China by examining its use in scientific journal articles.MethodsRelevant
        articles were identified by searching the Sinomed database using the terms:
        uterus prolapse, cystocele, proctocele, prolapse, and pelvic floor; limited
        to Chinese core journals in obstetrics and gynecology, from January 2004 to
        December 2014. We analyzed systems for grading POP severity and the adoption
        of POP-Q in different article categories and hospitals of different levels.
        For the last decade, with two 5-year groups (2005\u20132009; 2010\u20132014),
        the \u03C7^2 test was used to evaluate inter-group differences.ResultsIn a
        total of 429 articles, 331 included a staging system, 70.7% of which used
        POP-Q. The POP-Q system first appeared in 2004 in China, was reported in 50%
        of articles in 2007, and its highest use occurred in 2012 (89.5%). In 234
        POP-Q system-utilizing reports, operative treatment and basic research accounted
        for 73.1% and 14.0% respectively. POP-Q usage increased from 2005\u20132009
        to 2010\u20132014 in surgery-related articles (54.2% vs 85.2%; P = 0.000).
        The proportion of reports using POP-Q in level I, II, and III hospitals was
        20.0%, 35.4%, and 77.8% respectively.ConclusionsThe POP-Q system, first used
        in 2004 in China, is now the most commonly used grading system, with surgery
        reports and level III hospitals accounting for the largest proportion of POP-Q
        applications.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12055-015-0396-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12055-015-0396-z\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12055-015-0396-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12055-015-0396-z\"}],\"title\":\"A

        tumour, though an extremely rare entity in clinical practice, constitutes
        a great therapeutic challenge in view of its critical domain and function
        in thoracic cage. Neoplasm of sternum necessitates subtotal/total sternectomy
        that in turn mandates secure and concrete reconstruction to protect important
        thoracic organs and provide optimal cardio-respiratory function.MethodsThis
        report is based on retrospective study of three patients with sternal tumours
        for whom Senior Author performed subtotal sternal resection and reconstruction
        over a period from 2010 to 2012. A 29-year-old male presented with osteoclastoma
        of the manubrium and upper sternum and the other two with metachronal sternal
        metastasis from chondrosarcoma from the lower limb and carcinoma breast. Methyl
        methacrylate powder was initially mixed with sterile water to make into paste
        and then allowed to solidify exactly in the shape of excised sternum with
        or without costal cartilage and ribs. The rigid cast was then fitted into
        the gap and appropriately fixed which was reinforced with myocutaneous flap
        for cover using bilateral pectoralis major muscles.ResultsAll three patients
        made satisfactory recovery with stable chest wall, normal cardio-respiratory
        function and satisfactory cosmesis. Patients were followed up after 3\_weeks
        with clinical assessment and X-ray at 6\_months and yearly thereafter. Follow-up
        ranged from 2 to 4\_years with patients enjoying good quality of life. Secure
        repair was confirmed clinically and by CT scan (computed tomography) study

        during wound healing or cancer growth and progression depends on the establishment
        of a cellular microenvironment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are part of this
        cellular microenvironment, where they functionally modulate cell homing, angiogenesis,
        and immune modulation. MSC recruitment involves detachment of these cells
        from their niche, and finally MSC migration into their preferred niches; the
        wounded area, the tumor bed, and the BM, just to name a few. During this recruitment
        phase, focal proteolysis disrupts the extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture,
        breaks cell\u2013matrix interactions with receptors, and integrins, and causes
        the release of bioactive fragments from ECM molecules.\_MSC produce a broad
        array of proteases, promoting remodeling of the surrounding ECM through proteolytic
        mechanisms. The fibrinolytic system, with its main player plasmin, plays a
        crucial role in cell migration, growth factor bioavailability, and the regulation
        of other protease systems during inflammation, tissue regeneration, and cancer.
        Key components of the fibrinolytic cascade, including the urokinase plasminogen

        of the fibrinolytic system for MSC recruitment and the functional consequences

        PNI in SACC. Slug, one of the most effective promoters of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
        transition (EMT), has been found to be associated with PNI in SACC. The aim
        of the present study was to investigate the roles and relationships of Slug,
        EMMPRIN, and E-cadherin in the PNI process of SACC. The expression levels
        of Slug, EMMPRIN, and E-cadherin in 115 primary SACC cases were statistically
        analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Simultaneously, the SACC cell line SACC-83
        was transfected with recombinant plasmids of silencing Slug (si-Slug) and/or
        silencing EMMPRIN (si-EMMPRIN). The functions of Slug and EMMPRIN in the EMT
        and PNI process were assessed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), western
        blotting, morphological observation, scratch test, migration assay, and in
        vitro perineural invasion assay. The immunohistochemical statistics revealed
        that the high expression of Slug and EMMPRIN and the low expression of E-cadherin
        were significantly associated with the PNI of SACC ( P \u2009\\u003c\u20090.05).
        Slug expression was significantly associated with EMMPRIN expression ( P \u2009\\u003c\u20090.05),
        and Slug expression and EMMPRIN expression were both significantly negatively
        associated with E-cadherin expression ( P \u2009\\u003c\u20090.05). Slug and
        EMMPRIN silencing both significantly inhibited EMMPRIN expression but promoted
        E-cadherin expression in SACC-83 cells ( P \u2009\\u003c\u20090.01). The series
        of in vitro assays revealed that silencing of Slug, EMMPRIN, or both induced
        cell morphology changes and inhibited tumor cell motility and PNI ability
        in SACC-83 cells ( P \u2009\\u003c\u20090.01). These results suggested that
        Slug silencing could inhibit the EMT process by downregulating EMMPRIN and
        then upregulating E-cadherin in the PNI process of SACC. The present study
        indicated that Slug and EMMPRIN are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets
        for the diagnosis and treatment of PNI in human SACC.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10278-015-9824-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10278-015-9824-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10278-015-9824-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10278-015-9824-2\"}],\"title\":\"Analyzing

        is a seven week, facilitated, face-to-face group program. The design is a
        2 groups (intervention vs control) x 3 (pre-treatment vs post-treatment vs
        2\_month follow-up) repeated measures. Allocation to groups will be dependent
        upon recruitment; when groups have sufficient numbers, they will be assigned
        to the intervention condition, but participants recruited without a viable
        group will be assigned to the wait-list control condition. Eligible participants
        are young people aged 14 to 22\_years who have a parent diagnosed with cancer
        within the last 5\_years. Wait-list controls are offered the opportunity to
        participate in the program once they have completed their follow-up questionnaires.
        The target sample size is 65 participants in each condition. The primary hypothesis
        is that participants in the intervention will show significant reductions
        in distress and increases in psychological well-being relative to participants
        in the wait-list control group, and these effects will continue through two-month

        between the two conditions. Secondary analyses will focus on variables which

        this paper, we show how the slide-to-roll ratio (SRR), the contact kinematics
        and the surface energy all have important effects on the elastohydrodynamic

        type DLC/DLC provide the lowest coefficient of friction, in particular those
        DLC materials with the lowest surface energies (three different DLC coatings
        were used in this study). A friction reduction of up to 48\_%, compared to
        a steel/steel contact, was obtained. A surprising new finding from this investigation
        is that the friction in DLC contacts is significantly reduced for high SRRs,
        i.e. a difference of up to 27\_% was measured in the DLC/DLC contacts when
        the SRR increased from 0.5 (rolling prevails) to 1.8 (sliding prevails). However,
        even more surprising is the effect of the SRR on the friction in mixed steel/DLC
        contacts, which is related to the contact design and its kinematics. We found
        that if the DLC is coated on the slower surface, a high SRR will not reduce
        the friction to any significant extent, typically about 5\_%, and at most

        use of wireless sensor networks to protect sensitive facilities or international
        borders has recently attracted more and more attention. It has become a high-priority
        issue in many countries. In addition to the physical fences built for stopping
        illegal intruders from crossing the border, smart fencing has been proposed
        to extend intrusion-detection capabilities. Event detection is a central component
        in numerous wireless sensor network applications. In spite of this, the area
        of event description has not received enough attention. The majority of current
        event description approaches rely on using precise values to specify event
        thresholds. However, these crisp values cannot adequately handle the imprecise
        sensor readings. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid event-detection algorithm
        based on two layers of 12-bit-resolution fuzzy logic system is used, which
        significantly improves the accuracy of event detection. Each sensor node has
        sensors to improve the precision of the detection system, as well as reducing
        the false alarm rate especially in a noisy environment. The proposed system
        was modeled using Matlab and designed using VHDL. The proposed system\u2019s
        VHDL code has been compared with the Matlab model, which provided very close
        results to this software-based controller model, and also with two other VHDL-based
        designs, results of which are also close and comparable to the proposed system.
        The proposed design is then implemented using a FPGA kit, and the prototype

        integration of multimedia-assisted healthcare systems with could-computing
        services and mobile technologies has led to increased accessibility for healthcare
        providers and patients. Utilizing cloud computing infrastructures and virtualization
        technologies allows for the transformation of traditional healthcare systems
        that demand manual care and monitoring to more salient, automatic and cost
        effective systems. The goal of this paper is to develop a multimedia-assisted
        mobile healthcare application using cloud-computing virtualization technologies.
        We consider calorie measurement as an example healthcare application that
        can benefit from cloud-computing virtualization technology. The key functionalities
        of our application entail image segmentation, image processing and deep learning
        algorithms for food classification and recognition. Client side devices (e.g.
        smartphones, tablets etc.) have limitations in handling time sensitive and
        computationally intensive algorithms pertained to our application. Image processing
        and deep learning algorithms, used in food recognition and calorie measurement,
        consume devices\u2019 batteries quickly, which is inconvenient for the user.
        It is also very challenging for client side devices to scale for large number
        of data and images, as needed for food recognition. The entire process is
        time-consuming and inefficient and discomforting from users\u2019 perspective
        and may deter them from using the application. In this paper, we address these
        challenges by proposing a virtualization mechanism in cloud computing that
        utilizes the Android architecture. Android allows for parting an application
        into activities run by the front-end user and services run by the back-end
        tasks. In the proposed virtualization mechanism, we use both the hosted and
        the hypervisor models to publish our Android-based food recognition and calorie
        measurement application in the cloud. By so doing, the users of our application
        can control their virtual smartphone operations through a dedicated client
        application installed on their smartphones, while the processing of the application
        continue to run on the virtual Android image even if the user is disconnected
        due to any unexpected event. We have performed several experiments to validate
        our mechanism. Specifically, we have run our deep learning and image processing
        algorithms for food recognition on different configuration platforms on both
        the cloud and local server connected to the mobile. The results show that
        the accuracy of the system with the virtualization mechanism is more than
        94.33\_% compared to 87.16\_% when we run the application locally. Also, with
        our virtualization mechanism the results are processed 49\_% faster than the
        case of running the application locally.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00450-015-0297-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00450-015-0297-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00450-015-0297-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00450-015-0297-9\"}],\"title\":\"Editorial

        on protoplast fusion is a biotechnological tool enabling multiple resistance
        genes or traits to be transferred from wild relatives into crops. A key step
        for successful regeneration of hybrids is the selection of the heterokaryons.
        Selection can be done on specific culture media, by using intrinsic cellular
        or fluorescent markers, or specific traits of the fusion products, such as
        vigorous growth. More vigorous growth is one of the most common used criteria,
        since it does not require the use of mutants and allows faster selection of
        putative somatic hybrids. However, vigorous growth does not occur in all fusion
        combinations and often additional approaches have to be used (molecular markers,
        flow cytometry, chromosome counts, etc.) which are more costly and time consuming.
        There is, therefore, a need for the development of a faster, simpler, more
        cost-effective and reliable method for the selection of the heterospecific
        fusion products. Our study reports the effective use of the reporter gene
        gfp to confirm the vigorous growth as a reproducible selection for the somatic
        hybrids between Solanum tuberosum dihaploid line and the wild species S. chacoense
        . In vitro shoots of transgenic S. chacoense expressing the reporter gene
        gfp and a wild type dihaploid line of potato were used to isolate the mesophyll
        protoplasts. Electrofusion of mesophyll protoplasts and standard culture methods
        were applied. The S. chacoense gfp +\_protoplasts were unable to regenerate
        and when parental protoplast and putative somatic hybrid cultures were monitored,
        the GFP was expressed and visualized microscopically only in hybrid regenerants
        showing vigorous growth. The results confirmed that vigorous growth can be
        used to select the fusion products between these two species. This strategy
        might be applied to other fusion combinations to improve somatic hybrid selection.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12471-015-0743-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12471-015-0743-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12471-015-0743-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12471-015-0743-0\"}],\"title\":\"Trends

        data could provide high positive predictive value for the presence of OSA.MethodsWe
        conducted a prospective observational study of consecutive unattended sleep
        study patients at a single facility. Patients were referred for sleep testing
        after chart review by a sleep physician. We assessed area under the receiver-operating
        characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and positive predictive value (PPV) of STOP-BANG
        score and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) for a respiratory disturbance index
        (RDI) \u226515/h.ResultsAmong 234 test patients, 65\_% had an RDI \u226515/h.
        STOP-BANG had poor ability to discriminate these patients (ROC AUC 0.62).
        ODI added significant diagnostic information to the STOP-BANG score, increasing
        the ROC AUC to 0.86. Having the ODI, the STOP-BANG score no longer contributed
        significant diagnostic information, and the ODI alone discriminated as well
        as the combination (ROC AUC 0.86). Forty nine percent had an ODI \u22657/h,

        through the UFS-QOL.ResultsThe pre-treatment target volume mean value was
        of 59.7\_cc; the MRgFUS-TV had a mean value of 44.9\_cc, and the mean value
        of CE MRI-TV, measured immediately after treatment, was of 52.8\_cc, with
        an increase of 13.7\_%. The 86.5\_% of the lesion was treated. After 1\_year
        from the treatment, 15/18 (83\_%) patients showed thickness of the junctional
        zone \\u003c12\_mm; 3/18 (17\_%) had a junctional zone \\u003e12\_mm.ConclusionMRgFUS
        is an encouraging mini-invasive treatment for adenomyosis that permits to

        Although the majority of research on SME internationalization concerns developed

        most of the literature on international entrepreneurship neglects the role

        with regard to the factors that affect performance on various levels of foreign

        environment makes this fleeting process even more complicated. It is necessary
        to get a deeper understanding of wet welding process by numerical analysis

        protease inhibitor approved for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, as
        a component of combination therapy. Simeprevir is metabolized by the cytochrome
        P450 (CYP) system, primarily CYP3A, and is a substrate for several drug transporters,
        including the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs). It is susceptible
        to metabolic drug\u2013drug interactions with drugs that are moderate or strong
        CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir and erythromycin) or CYP3A inducers (e.g.
        rifampin and efavirenz); coadministration of these drugs may increase or decrease
        plasma concentrations of simeprevir, respectively, and should be avoided.
        Clinical studies have shown that simeprevir is a mild inhibitor of CYP1A2
        and intestinal CYP3A but does not inhibit hepatic CYP3A. The effects of simeprevir
        on these enzymes are of clinical relevance only for narrow-therapeutic-index
        drugs that are metabolized solely by these enzymes (e.g. oral midazolam).
        Simeprevir does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics
        of rilpivirine, tacrolimus, oral contraceptives and several other drugs metabolized
        by CYP enzymes. Simeprevir is a substrate and inhibitor of the transporters
        P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and OATP1B1/3.
        Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of OATP1B1/3, BCRP and P-gp, and a mild inhibitor
        of CYP3A; cyclosporine causes a significant increase in simeprevir plasma
        concentrations, and coadministration is not recommended. Clinical studies
        have demonstrated increases in coadministered drug concentrations for drugs
        that are substrates of the OATP1B1/3, BRCP (e.g. rosuvastatin) and P-gp (e.g.
        digoxin) transporters; these drugs should be administered with dose titration
        and or/close monitoring.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12312-015-1371-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12312-015-1371-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12312-015-1371-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12312-015-1371-8\"}],\"title\":\"Assistierter

        nociceptive neurons are a sub-population of small diameter primary sensory
        neurons that comprise approximately 50\_% of the C fiber population. Together
        with the peptidergic sub-population, they transmit nociceptive information
        from the periphery to the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Despite
        the numerous studies investigating the role of the non-peptidergic primary
        afferents, their role in normal nociception and in pain remains poorly understood.
        Our lab has previously demonstrated that, in rat models of neuropathic and
        inflammatory pain, there is a de novo expression of substance P receptors
        (NK-1r) by lamina I pyramidal projection neurons, a neuronal population that
        normally does not express these receptors.ResultsIn this study, we used a
        ribosomal toxin, saporin, conjugated to the lectin IB4 to selectively ablate
        the non-peptidergic nociceptive C fibers, to investigate if the loss of these
        fibers was enough to induce a change in NK-1r expression by lamina I projection
        neurons. IB4-saporin treatment led to the permanent ablation of the IB4-positive
        afferents but also to a small non-significant reduction in CGRP-positive afferents.
        An overall increase in immunoreactivity for the NK-1r was observed in lamina
        I projection neurons, however, the lack of non-peptidergic afferents did not
        increase the number of lamina I pyramidal projection neurons immunoreactive
        for the receptor.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that the deletion of the
        non-peptidergic afferents, at the L4\u2013L5 spinal levels, is not sufficient
        to trigger the de novo expression of NK-1r by projection pyramidal neurons
        but increases the expression of NK-1r in fusiform and multipolar projection
        neurons. Furthermore, our data suggest that a neuropathic component is essential
        to trigger the expression of NK-1r by pyramidal neurons.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12144-015-9365-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12144-015-9365-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12144-015-9365-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12144-015-9365-3\"}],\"title\":\"Spanish

        the linearization of C _2 as input to linearize C _1. In this way we obtain
        an equation that we called DHESS1 , which in previous studies by other authors
        was simply postulated. Next we derive a wave equation (called DHESS2 ) for
        a free spin 1/2 fermion in the de Sitter manifold using a heuristic argument
        which is an obvious generalization of a heuristic argument (described in detail
        in Appendix D) permitting a derivation of the Dirac equation in Minkowski
        spacetime and which shows that such famous equation express nothing more than
        the fact that the momentum of a free particle is a constant vector field over
        timelike integral curves of a given velocity field. It is a remarkable fact
        that DHESS1 and DHESS2 coincide. One of the main ingredients in our paper
        is the use of the concept of Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields. Appendices B and
        C recall this concept and its relation with covariant Dirac spinor fields
        usually used by physicists.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11325-015-1252-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11325-015-1252-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11325-015-1252-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11325-015-1252-5\"}],\"title\":\"Increased

        sleep apnea (OSA) is known to be a risk factor of coronary artery disease.
        Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), as a critical factor for monocyte
        infiltration, is known to play a role in the development of atherosclerosis.
        This study aimed to investigate the effect of intermittent hypoxia, the hallmark
        of OSA, on the MCP-1 expression of monocytes.MethodsPeripheral blood was sampled
        from 61 adults enrolled for suspected OSA. RNA was prepared from the isolated
        monocytes for the analysis of MCP-1. The effect of in vitro intermittent hypoxia
        on the regulation and function of MCP-1 was investigated on THP-1 monocytic
        cells and human monocytes. The mRNA and secreted protein levels were investigated
        by RT/real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.ResultsMonocytic
        MCP-1 gene expression was found to be increased significantly in severe OSA
        patients. In vitro intermittent hypoxia was demonstrated to increase the mRNA
        and protein expression levels of MCP-1 dose- and time-dependently in THP-1
        monocytic cells. The MCP-1 mRNA expression in monocytes isolated from OSA
        patient was induced to a much higher level compared to that from normal control.
        Pre-treatment with inhibitor for p42/44 MAPK or p38 MAPK suppressed the activation
        of MCP-1 expression by intermittent hypoxia.ConclusionsThis is the first study
        to demonstrate the increase of MCP-1 gene expression in monocytes of severe
        OSA patients. In addition, monocytic MCP-1 gene expression can be induced
        under intermittent hypoxia.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4424-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4424-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10967-015-4424-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10967-015-4424-7\"}],\"title\":\"Influence

        aim of this article is to review the literature and elaborate current topics
        for non-cancer patients at the end of life in primary palliative care.Material
        and methodsA literature search was carried out in the databases PubMed and
        Scopus from 2008 to 2013 followed by a qualitative content analysis according
        to the PRISMA statement.ResultsA total of 127 articles could be included in
        the qualitative content analysis and the final review whereby four core topics
        were identified: (1) specific target groups (e.g. elderly patients, patients
        with advanced heart failure and pain), (2) collaboration of general practitioners
        with other physicians and health professions, (3) qualifications in palliative
        care and (4) provision of primary palliative care. Most articles found were
        related to the fourth topic and the subtopic of barriers and facilitators
        of palliative care. Insufficient coordination of the persons involved was
        a barrier often discussed. Advanced care planning including concrete aspects
        of palliative care at an early stage can be beneficial for both patients and
        professionals.ConclusionThe current literature search elucidates the importance
        of optimizing the processes and structures in providing palliative care and
        the discussion of end of life issues at an early stage in general practice.

        unclear. Thus, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship
        of the blood and stomach concentration of acotiamide with its inhibitory effect

        and acetylcholine (ACh) were determined after intravenous administration to
        rats and analyzed by physiologically-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
        (PBPK/PD) model containing vascular space, precursor pool and deep pool of
        stomach.ResultsAcotiamide was eliminated from the blood and stomach in a biexponential
        manner. Our PBPK/PD model estimated that acotiamide concentration in the precursor
        pool exceeded 2\_\u03BCM at approximately 2\_h after administration. Acotiamide
        inhibited AChE activity in vitro with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 1.79\_\u03BCM.

        mediated process and inhibited AChE in the precursor pool of stomach. Thus,
        Acotiamide in the precursor pool plays an important role for producing the

        (ASL) is a non-invasive MRI technique to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF).
        This review provides a practical guide and overview of the clinical applications
        of ASL of the brain, as well its potential pitfalls. The technical and physiological
        background is also addressed. At present, main areas of interest are cerebrovascular
        disease, dementia and neuro-oncology. In cerebrovascular disease, ASL is of
        particular interest owing to its quantitative nature and its capability to
        determine cerebral arterial territories. In acute stroke, the source of the
        collateral blood supply in the penumbra may be visualised. In chronic cerebrovascular
        disease, the extent and severity of compromised cerebral perfusion can be
        visualised, which may be used to guide therapeutic or preventative intervention.
        ASL has potential for the detection and follow-up of arteriovenous malformations.
        In the workup of dementia patients, ASL is proposed as a diagnostic alternative
        to PET. It can easily be added to the routinely performed structural MRI examination.
        In patients with established Alzheimer\u2019s disease and frontotemporal dementia,
        hypoperfusion patterns are seen that are similar to hypometabolism patterns
        seen with PET. Studies on ASL in brain tumour imaging indicate a high correlation
        between areas of increased CBF as measured with ASL and increased cerebral
        blood volume as measured with dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion
        imaging. Major advantages of ASL for brain tumour imaging are the fact that
        CBF measurements are not influenced by breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier,
        as well as its quantitative nature, facilitating multicentre and longitudinal
        studies.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13366-015-0267-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13366-015-0267-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13366-015-0267-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13366-015-0267-1\"}],\"title\":\"Results

        RIFLE classification is widely used to assess the severity of acute kidney
        injury (AKI), but its application to geriatric AKI patients complicated by
        medical problems has not been reported.MethodsWe investigated 256 geriatric
        patients (\u226565\_years old; mean age, 74.4\_\xB1\_6.3\_years) who developed
        AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU) according to the RIFLE classification.
        Etiologic, clinical, and prognostic variables were analyzed.ResultsThey were
        categorized into RIFLE-R ( n \_=\_53), RIFLE-I ( n \_=\_102), and RIFLE-F
        ( n \_=\_101) groups. The overall in-hospital mortality was 39.8\_%. There
        were no significant differences in RIFLE category between survivors and non-survivors.
        Survivors had significantly less needs for a ventilator and vasopressor, and
        lower number of failing organs. Survivors had higher systolic blood pressure,
        hemoglobin level, and serum albumin levels. We performed a logistic regression
        analysis to identify the independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.
        In a univariate analysis, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, RIFLE classification,
        number of failing organs, need for a ventilator and vasopressor, systolic
        blood pressure, hemoglobin level, and serum albumin levels were identified
        as prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. However, in a multivariate
        analysis, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, number of failing organs,
        and serum albumin levels were independent risk factors, with no significant
        difference for in-hospital mortality with the RIFLE classification.ConclusionThe
        RIFLE classification might not be associated with mortality in geriatric AKI
        patients in the ICU. In geriatric patients with AKI, various factors besides
        severity of AKI should be considered to predict mortality.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s40264-015-0344-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40264-015-0344-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40264-015-0344-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40264-015-0344-2\"}],\"title\":\"A

        comparative evaluation of benefits and risks is one of the most important
        tasks during the development, market authorization and post-approval pharmacovigilance
        of medicinal products. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been recommended
        to support decision making in the benefit\u2013risk assessment (BRA) of medicines.
        This paper identifies challenges associated with bias or variability that
        practitioners may encounter in this field and presents solutions to overcome
        them. The inclusion of overlapping or preference-complementary criteria, which
        are frequent violations to the assumptions of this model, should be avoided.
        For each criterion, a value function translates the original outcomes into
        preference-related scores. Applying non-linear value functions to criteria
        defined as the risk of suffering a certain event during the study introduces
        specific risk behaviours in this prescriptive, rather than descriptive, model
        and is therefore a questionable practice. MCDA uses weights to compare the
        importance of the model criteria with each other; during their elicitation
        a frequent situation where (generally favourable) mild effects are directly
        traded off against low probabilities of suffering (generally unfavourable)
        severe effects during the study is known to lead to biased and variable weights
        and ought to be prevented. The way the outcomes are framed during the elicitation
        process, positively versus negatively for instance, may also lead to differences
        in the preference weights, warranting an appropriate justification during
        each implementation. Finally, extending the weighted-sum MCDA model into a
        fully inferential tool through a probabilistic sensitivity analysis is desirable.
        However, this task is troublesome and should not ignore that clinical trial
        endpoints generally are positively correlated.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12665-015-4750-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12665-015-4750-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12665-015-4750-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4750-7\"}],\"title\":\"A

        most cases, climate change projections from General Circulation Models (GCM)

        studies, and downscaling is, therefore, needed. A large number of statistical
        downscaling methods exist, but no clear recommendations exist of which methods
        are more appropriate, depending on the application. This paper compares two
        different statistical downscaling methods, Pre_sim1 and Pre_sim2, using the
        Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) datasets and station
        observations. Both methods include two steps, but the major difference between
        them is how the CMIP5 dataset and the station data used. The downscaled precipitation
        data are validated with observations through China and Jiangxi province from
        1976 to 2005. Results show that GCMs cannot be used directly in climate change
        impact studies. In China, the second method Pre_sim2, which establishes regression

        Deshalb muss auch der Kardiologe einen uneingeschr\xE4nkten Zugang zu dieser

        reports from large cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging centers show that
        in almost all cases CMR-based imaging provides a comprehensive and definitive
        assessment of the clinical situation of patients. Therefore, cardiologists
        must also have unrestricted access to this imaging technique and following
        appropriate training should be able to perform CMR studies independently.
        This position statement describes high-quality criteria for scientific and
        clinical applications of CMR imaging, including three different levels of
        expertise: level 1 for a basic understanding of CMR imaging, level 2 for independent
        performance and interpretation of CMR studies and level 3 for training individuals
        in CMR imaging and directing a CMR laboratory. Comparison of the CMR curricula
        of the German Cardiac Society (DGK) and of the German Radiological Society
        (DRG) reveals significant quantitative and qualitative differences. This also
        applies to the special cardiovascular imaging centers of the DRG that, according
        to the view of the DGK, should only be established and directed by equally
        represented radiologists and cardiologists.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00199-015-0911-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00199-015-0911-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00199-015-0911-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00199-015-0911-x\"}],\"title\":\"Designing

        (As) is a widespread environmental contaminant present around the world in

        effect of acetyl- l -carnitine (ALC) on As-induced oxidative damage in male
        rats. Animals were randomly divided into four groups of control (saline),
        sodium arsenite (NaAsO_2, 20\_mg/kg), ALC (300\_mg/kg), and NaAsO_2 plus ALC.
        Animals were dosed orally for 28 successive days. Blood and tissue samples
        including kidney, brain, liver, heart, and lung were collected on the 28th
        day and evaluated for oxidative damage and histological changes. NaAsO_2 exposure
        caused a significant lipid peroxidation as evidenced by elevation in thiobarbituric
        acid-reactive substances (TBARS). The activity of antioxidant enzymes such
        as glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD),

        significantly suppressed the oxidative damage induced by NaAsO_2. Tissue histological
        studies have confirmed the biochemical findings and provided evidence for
        the beneficial role of ALC. The results concluded that ALC attenuated NaAsO_2-induced

        formaldehyde content in the \u201Cprogressive straightening\u201D creams can
        contain mutagens that could increase the incidence of neoplasia in those people
        who use them. Damage to DNA was assessed by conducting a micronuclei test
        (MNT) on buccal cells and the comet assay on heparinized venous blood samples.
        A total of 50 volunteers were recruited at six different beauty salons (labeled
        A to F). At two salons that used products that did not contain FD (salons
        D and E), environmental FD concentrations were 0.04 and 0.02\_ppm. In contrast,
        the products used at salons A, B, C, and F contained 5.7, 2.61, 5.9, and 5.79\_%
        of FD, and these salons had environmental FD concentrations of 0.07, 0.14,
        0.16, and 0.14\_ppm, respectively. Comparison of the beauty salon workers
        from each of the six beauty salons revealed significant differences in urinary
        formic acid (FA) concentration before exposure ( p \u2009=\u20090.016), urinary
        FA after exposure ( p \u2009=\u20090.004), variation in FA concentration before
        and after exposure ( p \u2009=\u20090.018), environmental FD concentration
        ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.001), cytogenetic damage detected by the comet assay
        according to both damage index ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.001) and frequency

        affects up to 6\u2009% of the population. The resulting spine deformity, the
        increasing risk of back pain, cosmetic aspects, pulmonary disorders if the
        Cobb angle is \\u003e\u200980\xB0, and the progress of the deformity to \\u003e\u200950\xB0
        after the end of growth indicate non-operative or operative therapy. In daily
        clinical practice, the classifications of scoliosis allow the therapy to be
        adapted. Classifications consider deformity, topography of the scoliosis,
        and the age at diagnosis. This publication gives an overview of the relevant
        and most common classifications in the treatment of adolescent scoliosis.
        For evaluation, the deformity measurement on the coronary radiographic projection
        of the total spine (Cobb angle) is relevant to therapy. The classification
        of topography, form, and the sagittal profile of the deformity of the spine
        are useful for preoperative planning of the fusion level. Classifications
        that take into account the age at the time of the diagnosis of scoliosis differentiate
        among early onset scoliosis (younger than 10 years of age), adolescent scoliosis
        (up to the end of growth), and adult scoliosis. Early onset scoliosis is subdivided
        by age and etiology. Therapy is derived from the classification of clinical
        and radiological findings. Classifications that take into account clinical
        and radiological parameters are essential components of modern scoliosis therapy.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11090-015-9650-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11090-015-9650-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11090-015-9650-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11090-015-9650-9\"}],\"title\":\"Thermal

        including geometry, dimension, and surface roughness, are an important part
        of production where the desire to manufacture quality products have to be
        weighed against the increase of manufacturing costs. The desired tolerance
        will influence the choice of both manufacturing method and machine tool. Given
        that machining is an adequate production method, variation of the required
        tolerances will imply a variation of the part cost which needs to be taken
        into account during production planning. Thus, the term \u201Ctolerance cost\u201D
        is introduced. The paper presents a model for evaluating the tolerance cost
        in respect to the surface roughness during longitudinal turning operations,
        enabling a better comparison between different production alternatives. Through
        knowledge of the required surface roughness, it is possible to estimate appropriate
        cutting conditions. Knowledge of the cutting conditions and the part geometry
        then makes it possible to calculate the cycle time, information which in turn
        may be used for calculating the corresponding part cost. Through using experimental
        data, it is proven that the required surface roughness has a significant influence
        on the attained manufacturing cost. For instance, while longitudinally turning
        AISI 4140, it was shown that an improvement of the surface roughness from
        R _ a \u2009=\u20093.2\_\u03BCm to R _ a \u2009=\u20091.6\_\u03BCm will entail
        an increase of the part cost by roughly 20\_%. Similarly, a decrease of the
        required surface quality (larger R _ a value) will imply a significantly reduced
        part cost.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10265-015-0750-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10265-015-0750-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10265-015-0750-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-015-0750-7\"}],\"title\":\"Flower

        frequency-dependent selection derived from positive frequency-dependent foraging
        is the best-known selection force maintaining genetic polymorphism within
        a population. However, in flowering plants, positive frequency-dependent foraging
        by pollinators is expected to accelerate the loss of low-frequency morphs
        by conferring a fitness advantage to the common morph, leading to monomorphism.
        In Japan, a non-native species, Sisyrinchium sp., exhibits conspicuous flower
        color polymorphism within a population comprising both purple morphs (homozygous
        recessive) and white morphs (heterozygous or homozygous dominant). Here we
        quantified genotype-specific reproductive success in order to reveal the contribution
        of overdominant selection on the maintenance of flower color polymorphism
        in this species. In artificial pollination experiments using individuals with
        identified genotypes, female reproductive success was higher in the heterozygote
        than in either homozygote. The frequency of purple morphs in natural populations
        (ca. 31\_%) is similar to the frequency predicted by overdominant selection
        (25\_%). Our results suggest that overdominant selection contributes to the

        from trips is challenging for transfemoral amputees, and attempts often result
        in falls. Better understanding of the effects of the sensory-motor deficits
        brought by amputation and the functional limitations of prosthetic devices
        could help guide therapy and fall prevention mechanisms in prostheses. However,
        how transfemoral amputees attempt to recover from trips on the sound and prosthesis
        sides throughout swing phase is poorly understood.MethodsWe tripped eight
        able-bodied subjects and eight unilateral transfemoral amputees wearing their
        prescribed prostheses. The protocol consisted of six repetitions of 6 and
        4 points throughout swing phase, respectively. We compared recovery strategies
        in able-bodied, sound side and prosthesis side limbs. The number of kinematic
        recovery strategies used, when they were used throughout swing phase, and
        kinematic characteristics (tripped limb joint angles, bilateral trochanter
        height and time from foot arrest to foot strike) of each strategy were compared
        across limb groups. Non-parametric statistical tests with corrections for
        post-hoc tests were used.ResultsAmputees used the same recovery strategies
        as able-bodied subjects on both sound and prosthesis sides, although not all
        subjects used all strategies. Compared to able-bodied subjects, amputees used
        delayed-lowering strategies less often from 30-60\_% of swing phase on the
        sound side, and from 45-60\_% of swing phase on the prosthesis side. Within-strategy
        kinematic differences occurred across limbs; however, these differences were
        not consistent across all strategies. Amputee-specific recovery strategies\u2014that
        are not used by control subjects\u2014occurred following trips on both the
        sound and prosthesis sides in mid- to late swing.ConclusionsCollectively,
        these results suggest that sensory input from the distal tripped leg is not
        necessary to trigger able-bodied trip recovery strategies. In addition, the
        differences between sound and prosthesis side recoveries indicate that the
        ability of the support leg might be more critical than that of the tripped
        leg when determining the response to a trip. The outcomes of this study have
        implications for prosthesis control, suggesting that providing correct and
        intuitive real-time selection of typical able-bodied recovery strategies by
        a prosthetic device when it is the tripped and the support limb could better
        enable balance recovery and avoid falls.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00737-015-0570-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00737-015-0570-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00737-015-0570-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00737-015-0570-8\"}],\"title\":\"Routine

        efflux pumps such as ABCG2 confer drug resistance to a number of cancer types,
        leading to poor prognosis and outcome. To date, the strategy of directly inhibiting
        multidrug efflux pumps in order to overcome drug resistance in cancer has
        been unsuccessful. An alternative strategy is to target proteins involved
        in the regulation of multidrug efflux pump activity or expression. Pim1 kinase
        has been demonstrated to phosphorylate ABCG2, promote its oligomerisation
        and contribute to its ability to confer drug resistance.MethodsIn the present
        manuscript, imidazo-pyridazine-based inhibitors of Pim1 were examined for
        their ability to overcome ABCG2-mediated drug resistance. Drug efficacy was
        measured as a cytotoxic response or an effect on transport by ABCG2. Protein
        expression patterns were assessed using western immuno-blotting.ResultsThe
        two Pim1 inhibitors increased the potency of flavopiridol, mitoxantrone, topotecan
        and doxorubicin, specifically in ABCG2-expressing cells. This effect was associated
        with an increase in the cellular accumulation of [^3H]-mitoxantrone, suggesting
        direct impairment of the transporter. However, prolonged pre-incubation with
        the studied inhibitors greatly enhanced the effect on mitoxantrone accumulation.
        The inhibitors caused a significant time-dependent reduction in the expression
        of ABCG2 in the resistant cells, an effect that would improve drug efficacy.ConclusionConsequently,
        it appears that the Pim1 inhibitors display a dual-mode effect on ABCG2-expressing
        cancer cells. This may provide a powerful new strategy in overcoming drug
        resistance by targeting proteins that regulate expression of efflux pumps.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11095-015-1788-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11095-015-1788-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11095-015-1788-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11095-015-1788-x\"}],\"title\":\"Oxaprozin-Loaded

        Resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) and photosystem II inhibiting herbicides
        was confirmed in a population of allotetraploid annual bluegrass ( Poa annua
        L.; POAAN-R3) selected from golf course turf in Tennessee. Genetic sequencing
        revealed that seven of eight POAAN-R3 plants had a point mutation in the psbA
        gene resulting in a known Ser-264-Gly substitution on the D1 protein. Whole
        plant testing confirmed that this substitution conferred resistance to simazine
        in POAAN-R3. Two homeologous forms of the ALS gene (ALSa and ALSb) were detected
        and expressed in all POAAN-R3 plants sequenced. The seven plants possessing
        the Ser-264-Gly mutation conferring resistance to simazine also had a homozygous

        in one codon. In vitro ALS activity assays with recombinant protein and whole

        method using trimethylsilylation and performed two calibration techniques:
        exact matching approach and calibration curve. Performance of the method and
        calibration techniques were evaluated for their suitability for the characterization
        of a CRM candidate carrying out studies to assign the property value and to
        assure homogeneity as well as short- and long-term stability. Both calibration
        approaches were equivalent in terms of accuracy and precision and presented

        Relative measurement uncertainties obtained with the exact matching approach

        hydrogen generation is one of the new topics in the field of renewable energy.
        Recently, the rate of investigation about hydrogen generation is growing dramatically
        in many countries. Many studies have been done about hydrogen generation from
        natural resources such as wind, solar, coal etc. In this work we evaluated
        global scientific production of solar hydrogen generation papers from 2001
        to 2014 in any journal of all the subject categories of the Science Citation
        Index compiled by Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Philadelphia,
        USA. Solar hydrogen generation was used as keywords to search the parts of
        titles, abstracts, or keywords. The published output analysis showed that
        hydrogen generation from the sun research steadily increased over the past
        14\_years and the annual paper production in 2013 was about three times 2010-paper
        production. The number of papers considered in this research is 141 which
        have been published from 2001 to this date. There are clear distinctions among
        author keywords used in publications from the five most high-publishing countries
        such as USA, China, Australia, Germany and India in solar hydrogen studies.
        In order to evaluate this work quantitative and qualitative analysis methods
        were used to the development of global scientific production in a specific
        research field. The analytical results eventually provide several key findings

        this study the influence of the surface structure on the anode boundary of
        high intensity arcs in atmosphere is investigated. It was found that the surface
        structure of an anode has a significant influence on the anode fall voltage,
        which we claim can be caused by field enhancements. The tested anode material
        is copper. In order to produce different field enhancing surface structures
        induced by micro peaks, the samples are sandblasted with different grain sizes.
        For the determination of the field a new method is proposed and a field enhancement
        factor is defined. This is done by approximating the sample surfaces with
        ideal peaks, whose height is calculated using the roughness and whose base
        is calculated based on SEM-images. Knowing the geometry of the peaks it is
        possible to simulate the electric field and then calculate the field enhancement
        factor. The prepared samples are tested with TIG-like plasmas applying different
        parameters. While moving the arc across a prepared sample, voltage and current
        measurements take place with parallel high speed stereo image acquisition.
        Using the measured arc voltages, the calculated fields and a modified form
        of the Child-Langmuir law, it is possible to calculate the anode drop voltage.
        To verify the innovative method, Langmuir-probe measurements are performed.
        The results are in good agreement and are evidence that the method used for
        the determination of the field enhancement and the physical model based on
        the Child-Langmuir law are useful approximations.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s40737-015-0035-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40737-015-0035-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40737-015-0035-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40737-015-0035-4\"}],\"title\":\"Study

        The Author(s)\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractIntroductionNew vaccines
        are being developed to improve the efficacy of seasonal influenza immunization
        in elderly persons aged \u226565\_years. These products require clinical and
        economic evaluation to aid policy decisions.MethodsTo address this need, a
        two-part model has been developed, which we have applied to examine the potential
        clinical and economic impact of vaccinating elderly persons with adjuvanted
        trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (aTIV) relative to conventional trivalent
        (TIV) and quadrivalent (QIV) vaccines. We compared outcomes in the US population
        for (1) aTIV in persons aged \u226565\_years and QIV in all other age cohorts;
        (2) QIV in all cohorts; (3) TIV in all cohorts. Low, average, and high intensity
        seasons with low, average, and high vaccine match scenarios were compared.
        Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted within each discrete scenario
        to explore the impact of variation in model inputs on potential outcomes.ResultsAssuming
        current vaccination coverage rates in the US population with (a) 25% better
        efficacy of adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted vaccine against any strain and
        (b) 35% better efficacy of non-adjuvanted vaccine against matched B versus
        mismatched B strains, use of aTIV in persons aged \u226565\_years and QIV
        in persons \\u003c65\_years could reduce influenza cases by 11,166\u20131,329,200,
        hospitalizations by 1365\u201343,674, and deaths by 421\u201311,320 versus
        use of QIV in all cohorts. These outcomes are reflected in a corresponding
        increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 3003\u201394,084. If the
        prevalence of mismatched influenza B was \\u003e54.5% of all circulating strains,
        use of QIV in all cohorts would offset the clinical benefits of aTIV. Elderly
        aTIV or QIV vaccination was associated with improved outcomes over non-adjuvanted
        TIV in many of the scenarios, particularly in low match seasons of any intensity.
        Total cost savings (including direct and indirect healthcare costs plus productivity
        impacts) with aTIV in the elderly versus QIV in the whole population ranged
        from $27\_million (low intensity, low match) to $934\_million (high intensity,
        high match). Univariate sensitivity analysis of relative vaccine prices in
        the average intensity, average match scenario indicated that aTIV could be
        marginally cost saving relative to QIV at the currently published Medicare
        price for influenza vaccines offering enhanced efficacy in the elderly. Elderly
        vaccination with aTIV was associated with a higher overall cost compared with
        TIV in only two scenarios (low intensity with average or high match); the
        incremental cost/QALY relative to TIV was $9980 in the average match scenario
        and $28,800 in the high match scenario.ConclusionsVaccination of persons aged
        \u226565\_years with aTIV has the potential to provide clinical and economic
        benefit relative to QIV and TIV. The new model allows the assessment of various
        alternative strategies for available influenza vaccines.FundingNovartis Vaccines.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12312-015-1373-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12312-015-1373-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12312-015-1373-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12312-015-1373-6\"}],\"title\":\"Station\xE4re

        was not always the case. During the colonial period (c. 1530\u20131825), indigenous
        communities were decimated by disease or massacred by white settlers. In the
        20th century, the Brazilian government introduced integrationist policies,
        which aimed to locate native populations and integrate them into mainstream
        society. These integrationist policies were implemented through education
        and the opening of new agricultural frontiers. However, in the last quarter
        of the 20th century, these integrationist policies were replaced by an approach
        valuing diversity and the right to a differentiated educational system, for
        indigenous communities to choose at their own discretion. Based on recent
        census data, this article begins with a discussion of the current situation

        surface charge of nanoparticles is an important factor that controls efficiency
        and cellular uptake. The aim of this study was to investigate\_the efficacy
        of curcumin nanoparticles (Cur-NPs) with different surface charges, in terms
        of toxicity, internalization, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities
        towards alveolar macrophages cells.MethodsThe surface charge of curcumin nanoparticles
        (positive, negative and neutral), with an average diameter of 30\_nm, were
        synthesized and characterized. Polyvinyl-alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone and
        dextran were used as coatings to confer negative, positive and neutral charges.
        The synthesized Cur-NPs were evaluated for particle size, encapsulation efficiency,
        surface charge, qualitative and quantitative cellular uptakes, anti-oxidant
        and anti-inflammatory activities.ResultsPositively charged nanoparticles showed
        higher cytotoxicity effects compared to negative and neutral particles. The
        same trend was observed in antioxidant activity, which included radical scavenging
        and nitric oxide production. In addition, the anti-inflammatory activity (interleukin-1\u03B2,
        IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1) depleted in the order: positive\\u003enegative\\u003eneutral.
        The void neutral-, positively- and negatively-charged nanoparticles did not

        Diabetes insipidus without intrasellar metastasis, intestinal intussusception,
        and paraneoplastic dysautonomia have not been reported in medullary thyroid
        cancer.Case presentationAn adult male with metastatic medullary thyroid cancer
        presented with hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypertension, acne-like
        rash, and diabetes insipidus (urine volume \\u003e8\_L/d, osmolality 190\_mOsm/kg).
        Serum cortisol, adrenocorticoitropic hormone, dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate,
        and urinary free cortisol were elevated 8, 20, 4.4, and 340 folds, respectively.
        Pituitary imaging was normal. Computed tomography scan revealed jejunal intussusception
        and incidental abdominal aortic dissection. Sorafenib treatment was associated
        with Cushing\u2019s syndrome remission, elevated progesterone (\\u003e10 fold),
        normalization of dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate, but persistently elevated
        cortisol concentration. Newly-developed proximal lower limb weakness and decreased
        salivation were associated with elevated ganglionic neuronal acetylcholine
        receptor (alpha-3) and borderline P/Q type calcium channel antibodies.ConclusionExtreme
        cortisol concentration may have contributed to aortic dissection and suppressed
        antidiuretic hormone secretion; which combined with hypokalemia due cortisol
        activation of mineralocorticoid receptors, manifested as diabetes insipidus.
        This is the first report of paraneoplastic dysautonomia and jejunal intussusception
        in medullary thyroid cancer, they may be related to medullary thyroid cancer\u2019s
        neuroendocrine origin and metastasis, respectively. Remission of Cushing\u2019s
        syndrome without measurable reduction in cortisol concentration suggests a
        novel cortisol-independent mechanism of action or assay cross-reactivity.
        Normalization of dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate and elevation of progesterone
        suggest inhibition of 17-hydroxylase and 21-hydroxylase activities by sorafenib.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11199-015-0537-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11199-015-0537-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11199-015-0537-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-015-0537-2\"}],\"title\":\"Untangling

        on career interest. Participants, drawn from introductory STEM classes ( N

        their preferences between pairs of occupations that differed in their gender
        stereotype. Within each occupation pair, one occupation was described as compatible
        with one of three goals (high salary, family-friendly, and helping others).
        A 1\_year follow-up was conducted on 148 of the original and an additional
        52 new participants ( N \_=\_200, 103 female). Results indicated that men

        hours (masculine stereotyped only). For women, family-friendly occupations
        were rated similarly to higher salary occupations, only in the feminine-stereotyped
        conditions. Findings were generally replicated at the second time point. These

        emerged from the analysis: individualisation; trust; motivation; and communication.
        The globalisation of newer technologies has triggered many substantial and
        widespread behaviour changes within society, yet users are unique in their
        use and interactions with such technologies. Trust is an ever present issue
        in terms of its potential impact on engagement with healthcare providers and
        motivation around self-management. The potential ability of technology to
        influence motivation through carefully selected and tailored messaging and
        to facilitate a personalised flow of communication between patient and healthcare
        provider was highlighted.ConclusionsNewer technologies such as mobile devices
        and the internet have been embraced across the globe despite technological
        challenges and concerns regarding privacy and security. In the design and
        development of technology based self-management tools for the treatment of
        hypertension, flexibility and security are vital to allow and encourage patients
        to customise, personalise and engage with their devices.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3138-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3138-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3138-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11661-015-3138-3\"}],\"title\":\"Elimination

        loss of active area due to the integrated series connection of thin-film solar
        cells is one of the major reasons for reduced cell-to-module efficiencies.
        Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the dead area losses to increase the module
        efficiency. In this work, the back-contact insulation process (P3) for thin-film
        silicon modules was evaluated for substrate side laser scribing with 532\_nm.
        A special emphasis was placed on the influence of the P3 scribe width reduction
        on the electrical properties of the solar module. A strong dependence of the
        ablation behavior on the processing beam radius and absorber thickness was
        observed. Calculations of the laser beam intensity distribution predict a
        decrease in heat-affected zone formation when the processing beam radius decreases.
        However, due to an increased ablation threshold fluence, measurements showed
        severe deterioration of the module properties for reduced beam radii. Raman
        microscopy revealed good agreement between extent/degree of absorber modification
        at the direct scribe edge, electrical evaluation, and scribe morphology for

        fields, such as road and bridge construction, and in conjunction with geothermal

        swelling is extremely difficult, and it is currently impossible to predict
        the swelling behavior of an actual geotechnical project. One of the reasons
        is our limited knowledge of the processes involved in the swelling of clay-sulfate

        controls of the swelling. This article presents a literature review of processes

        and aimVitamin D deficiency causes rickets and osteomalacia. As vitamin D
        metabolites have hormonal functions and bind to receptors of at least 38 different
        tissues the present study investigated whether low 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
        levels of children and adolescents are associated with effects on physical,
        mental and social health as well as health risks.Material and methodsA total
        of 17,641 participants constitute the basis of the German Child and Adolescent
        Health Survey (KiGGS). From the second of three study years onwards, 10,015
        serum 25(OH)D values were available from a total of 12,340 remaining participants
        (81\u2009%). These were analyzed for associations with selected physical,
        mental and social health indicators. Using the statistical package IBM SPSS
        20.0 bivariate and multivariable models were computed.ResultsIn the first
        3 years of life injuries, infections, developmental retardation, sleeping
        problems and poorer health were significantly (p\u2009\\u003c\u20090.01) associated
        with low values of 25(OH)D. In adolescents psoriasis, sleeping problems, poorer
        health, retarded development, poorer school performance, emotional and behavioral
        problems, lower quality of life and elevated cardiovascular risk factors were
        significantly (p\u2009\\u003c\u20090.01) more frequent if the 25(OH)D level
        was below 70\_nmol/l (28\_ng/ml).ConclusionThe evidence from cross-sectional
        studies is limited; however, the high quality of the representative data,
        control for confounding in multivariable models as well as the dose-response
        relationships and biological plausibility make these results highly relevant

        should be administered when necessary. Vitamin D deficiency is only a contributing
        factor and cannot on its own explain most of the problems reported. The recommended
        threshold value is 70\_nmol/l (28\_ng/ml). Longitudinal studies and randomized
        controlled trials (RCT) on the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation
        are essential. The basic provision of vitamin D in the population should be

        and hypothesisThe quality of Internet information on female urinary incontinence
        is considered variable. No comprehensive analysis exists to support this.
        We compared the quality of current Internet information for common layperson
        terminology on female urinary incontinence across four Western languages and
        a comparative analysis of website sponsors.MethodsWorld Health Organization
        Health on the Net (HON) principles may be applied to websites using an automated
        toolbar function. We used the Google search engine; 10,200 websites were identified
        using keywords related to female urinary incontinence and treatments in English,
        French, German and Spanish. The first 150 websites in each language had HON
        principles examined, whilst a further analysis of site sponsorship was undertaken.ResultsThe
        total number of websites for each term is variable. \u201CFemale sling surgery\u201D
        had the most websites with approximately 18\_million, whereas \u201Ccolposuspension\u201D
        had the least with only 159,890 websites. Regardless of language, very few
        female urinary incontinence websites were HON accredited ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.0001).
        Linguistically, French (18\_%) and English (16\_%) had the greatest percentage
        of HON-accredited sites. Tertiles (thirds) of the first 150 websites returned
        the higher percentage of HON-accredited websites ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.0001).
        Websites were largely sponsored by physicians/surgeons.ConclusionsThe lack
        of validation of most female urinary incontinence websites should be appreciated
        by clinicians. Additionally, discrepancies exist in the quality and number
        of websites across conditions, languages and also between medical and alternative

        female unskilled native workers. In addition, the long-term study discloses
        a slight occupational assimilation of male immigrants towards employment patterns

        radiotherapy is indicated in differentiated thyroid cancer patients with post-op
        gross residual disease or microscopic disease with high-risk features. Intensity-modulated
        radiotherapy (IMRT) is now the standard radiotherapy technique. This is a
        dosimetric study to compare the static-field IMRT and volumetric modulated
        arc therapy (VMAT) for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.MethodsConsecutive
        15 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer needed post-operative radiotherapy
        were recruited. A pair IMRT and VMAT plan was generated for each patient.
        Comparison of dosimetric parameters was performed between IMRT and VMAT. The
        monitor units (MU) and delivery time by each radiation technique were also
        compared.ResultsAll pairs of treatment plans in IMRT and VMAT fulfilled the
        acceptance requirement in terms of target coverage and critical organ sparing.
        The conformity index and homogeneity index between IMRT and VMAT for PTV66
        and PTV60 were not statistically significant. For the organs at risk, the
        mean dose to parotids was significantly increased by 4.8\_Gy (14.4\_%) in
        VMAT when compared to that in IMRT (IMRT vs. VMAT, 33.35\_\xB1\_6.86\_Gy vs.
        38.15\_\xB1\_7.82\_Gy, p \_=\_0.01). The dose parameters of the spinal cord,
        brain stem, esophagus, and lungs were not statistically significant between
        the two techniques. Compared to IMRT, the mean MU and delivery time of VMAT
        were reduced by 71.6\_% ( p \_=\_0.0004) and 63.1\_% ( p \_=\_0.004), respectively.ConclusionFor
        adjuvant radiotherapy for differentiated thyroid cancer, IMRT resulted in
        better parotid sparing at the expense of longer treatment time. Otherwise,
        the tumor coverage is essentially the same between these two techniques.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10008-015-3029-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10008-015-3029-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10008-015-3029-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10008-015-3029-y\"}],\"title\":\"Correlation

        food insecurity, another important risk factor for poor outcomes in people
        living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). We analyzed factors associated with low BMI and
        severe food insecurity in 523 PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy in rural

        Among those with severe food insecurity, 86\_% had a BMI\_\u2265\_18.5\_kg/m^2.
        Severe food insecurity was associated with illiteracy [adjusted odds ratio

        elucidate the distribution, function, and evolution of amino acid racemases
        in invertebrate animals. We searched the GenBank databases, and found 11 homologous
        serine racemase genes from eight species in eight different invertebrate phyla.
        The cloned genes were identified based on their maximum activity as Acropora
        millepora (Cnidaria) serine racemase (SerR) and aspartate racemase (AspR),
        Caenorhabditis elegans (Nematoda) SerR, Capitella teleta (Annelida) SerR,
        Crassostrea gigas (Mollusca) SerR and AspR, Dugesia japonica (Platyhelminthes)

        SerR and AspR and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinodermata) AspR. We found
        that Acropora , Aplysia , Capitella , Crassostrea and Penaeus had two amino
        acid racemase paralogous genes and these paralogous genes have evolved independently
        by gene duplication at their recent ancestral species. The transcriptome analyses
        using available SRA data and enzyme kinetic data suggested that these paralogous
        genes are expressed in different tissues and have different functions in vivo.
        Phylogenetic analyses clearly indicated that animal SerR and AspR are not
        separated by their particular racemase functions and form a serine/aspartate
        racemase family cluster. Our results revealed that SerR and AspR are more
        widely distributed among invertebrates than previously known. Moreover, we
        propose that the triple serine loop motif at amino acid positions 150\u2013152

        response to tamoxifen due to CYP2D6 polymorphism and adverse side effects
        are two clinical challenges in tamoxifen therapy. We report the development
        and preclinical testing of a boronic prodrug to orally deliver 4-OHT at therapeutically
        effective concentrations but at a fraction of the standard tamoxifen dose.MethodsA
        mouse xenograft tumor model was used to investigate the efficacy of ZB497
        in comparison with tamoxifen. Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to evaluate
        the metabolism and bioavailability of the drug in mice. Drug and metabolites
        distribution in xenograft tumor tissues was determined by high performance
        liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.ResultsThe boronic prodrug,
        ZB497, can not only be efficiently converted to 4-OHT in mice, but also afforded
        over 30 fold higher plasma concentrations of 4-OHT than in mice given either
        the same dose of 4-OHT or tamoxifen. Further, ZB497 was more effective than
        tamoxifen at lowered dosage in inhibiting the growth of xenograft tumors in
        mice. Consistent with these observations, ZB497 treated mice accumulated over
        6 times higher total drug concentrations than tamoxifen treated mice.ConclusionsOur
        study demonstrates that ZB497 effectively delivers a markedly increased plasma
        concentration of 4-OHT in mice. The boronic prodrug was shown to have far
        superior bioavailability of 4-OHT compared to tamoxifen or 4-OHT administration
        as measured by the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), plasma
        peak concentrations, and drug accumulation in tumor tissues. Further, ZB497
        proves to be a more efficacious hormone therapy than tamoxifen administered
        at a reduced dose in mice.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11425-015-5044-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11425-015-5044-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11425-015-5044-y\"}],\"title\":\"Spectral

        data regression is a fundamental mathematical tool in engineering and applied
        sciences. However, for complex nonlinear phenomena, the standard linear least-squares
        regression may prove ineffective, hence calling for more involved data modeling
        techniques. The current research work investigates in particular nonlinear
        statistical regression of bivariate data that do not exhibit a monotonic dependency.
        The current contribution proposes a neural-network-based data processing method,
        termed data monotonization , followed by neural isotonic statistical regression.
        Such data monotonization processing is performed by means of an adaptive neural
        network that learns its nonlinear transfer function from the training set.
        The artificial neural system that performs data monotonization is implemented
        through a lookup table (LUT), which entails few computationally inexpensive
        algebraic operations to adapt and to compute the output from the input data-set.
        A number of learning rules to adapt such LUT-based neural system are introduced

        of an already balanced large scale double MMAL, manufacturing cars, is modeled
        as an integer mathematical programming problem and optimized over four objective
        functions. Two classical multiobjective methods are implemented to solve the
        mathematical integer programming problem, as well as a synergy of them. The
        former two are: the compensatory one, global criterion method, and the non-compensatory
        one, method of satisfactory goals, proposed by Benson. In addition, the model
        is solved using a combination of the aforementioned methods, as proposed by
        the authors, which is coupling certain characteristics from both. All three
        methods make use of the preferences, extracted from a real decision maker,
        responsible for the management of the production, who is enabled to choose
        the most preferred among the optimal solutions. Finally, the results, obtained
        from the implementation of the three separate methods, are assessed with regard
        to their effectiveness and efficiency.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00044-015-1453-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00044-015-1453-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00044-015-1453-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00044-015-1453-2\"}],\"title\":\"Synthesis

        to replace the traditional floor stock system.MethodCosts were estimated before
        and after implementation of the ADS on the basis of floor stock inventories,

        ADS implementation, nurses spent less time on medication-related activities
        with an average of 14.7\_hours saved per day/33 beds. Pharmacy technicians
        spent more time on floor-stock activities with an average of 3.5 additional

        adequate management of scientific workflow applications strongly depends on
        the availability of accurate performance models of sub-tasks. Numerous approaches
        use machine learning to generate such models autonomously, thus alleviating
        the human effort associated to this process. However, these standalone models
        may lack robustness, leading to a decay on the quality of information provided
        to workflow systems on top. This paper presents a novel approach for learning
        ensemble prediction models of tasks runtime. The ensemble-learning method
        entitled bootstrap aggregating (bagging) is used to produce robust ensembles
        of M5P regression trees of better predictive performance than could be achieved
        by standalone models. Our approach has been tested on gene expression analysis
        workflows. The results show that the ensemble method leads to significant
        prediction-error reductions when compared with learned standalone models.
        This is the first initiative using ensemble learning for generating performance

        representations serve as a communication tool not only in exchanges between
        scientists but also in chemistry lessons. The goals of the present study were
        to measure the extent of student teachers\u2019 knowledge about chemical representations,
        focusing on chemical formulae and structures in particular, and to explore
        which factors related to the education in school and university contribute
        to inter-individual differences. Using a quantitative cross-sectional design,
        322 students from 12 German universities in different stages of their university
        education were tested with the Chemical Representations Inventory (CRI, Taskin,
        Bernholt, \\u0026 Parchmann, 2015 ). In addition, a short questionnaire was
        administered containing demographic data and possible factors that could have
        an effect on students\u2019 success in solving the items of the inventory.
        The data was analyzed by using Rasch modeling. The results show that student
        teachers\u2019 knowledge about chemical representations is quite low, with
        an average of students\u2019 total achievement of 50\_% in the corresponding
        inventory on chemical representations. A multivariate linear model revealed
        that passing exam(s) in organic chemistry at university, the grade of school
        leaving certificate, gender as well as studying chemistry in upper secondary
        school on basic and advanced levels are significant predictors of student
        teachers\u2019 knowledge. In total, these predictors are able to explain 30.3\_%
        of the variance in the test results. The dominance of school-related variables
        in the regression analysis indicates that school education seems to be still
        important after several years of studying and is not equalized by education

        tumorigenesis is not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the
        clinical significance and functional role of S100A16 in oral squamous cell
        carcinoma (OSCC) suppression.MethodsS100A16 mRNA and/or protein levels were
        examined by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in whole- and laser
        microdissected-specimens of normal human oral mucosa (NHOM, n \u2009=\u200965),
        oral dysplastic lesions (ODL, n \u2009=\u200921), OSCCs ( n \u2009=\u2009132)
        and positive cervical nodes ( n \u2009=\u200917). S100A16 protein expression
        in OSCC was examined for correlations with clinicopathological variables and
        patient survival. S100A16 was over-expressed and knocked-down in OSCC-derived
        (CaLH3 and H357) cells by employing retroviral constructs to investigate its
        effects on cell proliferation, sphere formation and three dimensional (3D)-organotypic
        invasive abilities in vitro and tumorigenesis in a mouse xenograft model.ResultsBoth
        S100A16 mRNA and protein levels were found to be progressively down-regulated
        from NHOM to ODL and OSCC. Low S100A16 protein levels in OSCC significantly
        correlated with reduced 10-year overall survival and poor tumor differentiation.
        Analysis of two external OSCC microarray datasets showed a positive correlation
        between the mRNA expression levels of S100A16 and keratinocyte differentiation
        markers. CaLH3 and H357 cell fractions enriched for differentiated cells either
        by lack of adherence to collagen IV or FACS sorting for low p75NTR expression
        expressed significantly higher S100A16 mRNA levels than the subpopulations
        enriched for less differentiated cells. Corroborating these findings, retroviral
        mediated S100A16 over-expression and knock-down in CaLH3 and H357 cells led
        to respective up- and down-regulation of differentiation markers. In vitro
        functional studies showed significant reduction in cell proliferation, sphere
        formation and 3D-invasive abilities of CaLH3 and H357 cells upon S100A16 over-expression.
        These functional effects were associated with concomitant down-regulation
        of self-renewal (Bmi-1 and Oct 4A) and invasion related ( MMP1 and MMP9 )
        molecules. S100A16 over-expression also suppressed tumorigenesis of H357 cells
        in a mouse xenograft model and the resulting tumor xenografts displayed features/expression
        of increased differentiation and reduced proliferation/self-renewal.ConclusionsThese
        results indicate that S100A16 is a differentiation promoting protein and might
        function as a tumor suppressor in OSCC.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1140/epja/i2015-15109-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1140/epja/i2015-15109-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epja/i2015-15109-9\"}],\"title\":\"The

        energy-weighted integrated cross-section for photon absorption --known as
        sum rule $ \\\\sigma_{-1}$ -- is under certain conditions proportional to
        the mean square nuclear radius (Levinger, Bethe (Phys. Rev. 78 , 115 (1950))).
        Due to the energy weight factor the low-energy absorption components are emphasized
        and the dipole transitions in the region of giant resonances contribute enhanced
        at $ \\\\sigma_{-1}$ . Thus, the cross-section of the full interaction can
        be replaced in good approximation by the dipole cross-section. Under these
        aspects, we have calculated $ \\\\sigma_{-1}$ and the radii of various gg-nuclei.
        For our purpose, we have chosen a simple shell model where the integrals can
        be solved analytically, and the contributions of uncorrelated functions and
        correlation corrections can be shown explicitly. The mean square radius as
        a function of $ \\\\sigma_{-1}$ differs by a factor of 1.5/0.87 from the previous
        result of Levinger and Kent (Phys. Rev. 95 , 418 (1954)) without correlation

        and the uncorrelated function $ f(A)$ as a ratio it shows that $ g(A)/f(A)$
        tends towards a limit. Finally, our results for the radii of gg-nuclei are
        in good agreement with recent experiments (I. Angeli, K.P. Marinova, At. Data

        at least in part a function of its content. In this paper, I argue that standard

        what I call the \u201Cdefeasibility problem\u201D. This problem arises from
        the combination of standard intentionalism with further plausible principles
        governing the epistemology of perception: that experience provides defeasible
        justification for empirical belief, and that such justification is best construed
        as probabilification. After exploring some ways in which the standard intentionalist

        of their agricultural information-seeking behavior. Although 75\_% of respondents
        had a mobile phone, the main mode of information sharing was face-to-face
        meetings for 97\_% of the elicited relationships. Mobile phones were used
        to communicate with people living at the edge of the regular physical mobility
        radius enabled by motorbikes (approximately 10\_km). A hierarchical logit
        model was applied to examine the implications of the respondents\u2019 tendency
        to use motorized transport vis-\xE0-vis walking for information gathering.
        Respondents with a higher general preference for faster transport tended to
        have more extensive access to information from other communities. However,
        we also find weak evidence that individual motorized transport might decrease
        internal social contact and information exchange inside these communities.
        The policy implication for rural development in less-industrialized countries
        is that providing ICTs without increasing the inhabitants\u2019 mobility through
        appropriate means may not significantly improve the inhabitants\u2019 access
        to important information and the diffusion of successful agricultural practices.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00396-015-3737-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00396-015-3737-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00396-015-3737-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00396-015-3737-y\"}],\"title\":\"Phase

        drug delivery systems (LBDDS) have gained significant attention in recent
        times, owing to their ability to overcome the challenges limiting the oral
        delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. Despite the successful commercialization
        of several LBDDS products over the years, a large discrepancy exists between
        the number of poorly water-soluble drugs displaying suboptimal in vivo performances
        and the application of LBDDS to mitigate their various delivery challenges.
        Conventional LBDDS, including lipid solutions and suspensions, emulsions,
        and self-emulsifying formulations, suffer from various drawbacks limiting
        their widespread use and commercialization. Accordingly, solid-state LBDDS,
        fabricated by adsorbing LBDDS onto a chemically inert solid carrier material,
        have attracted substantial interest as a viable means of stabilizing LBDDS
        whilst eliminating some of the various limitations. This review describes
        the impact of solid carrier choice on LBDDS performance and highlights the
        importance of appropriate solid carrier material selection when designing
        hybrid solid-state LBDDS. Specifically, emphasis is placed on discussing the
        ability of the specific solid carrier to modulate drug release, control lipase
        action and lipid digestion, and enhance biopharmaceutical performance above
        the original liquid-state LBDDS. To encourage the interested reader to consider
        their solid carrier choice on a higher level, various novel materials with
        the potential for future use as solid carriers for LBDDS are described. This
        review is highly significant in guiding future research directions in the
        solid-state LBDDS field and fostering the translation of these delivery systems

        expression is upregulated during sexual reproduction of Hyacinthus orientalis
        , and the protein is localized both in the cytoplasm and a highly specialized
        cell wall within the female gametophyte.AbstractSeveral evidences indicate
        calreticulin (CRT) as an important calcium (Ca^2+)-binding protein that is
        involved in the generative reproduction of higher plants, including both pre-fertilization
        and post-fertilization events. Because CRT is able to bind and sequester exchangeable
        Ca^2+, it can serve as a mobile intracellular store of easily releasable Ca^2+
        and control its local cytosolic concentrations in the embryo sac. This phenomenon
        seems to be essential during the late progamic phase, gamete fusion, and early
        embryogenesis. In this report, we demonstrate the differential expression
        of CRT within Hyacinthus female gametophyte cells before and during anthesis,
        during the late progamic phase when the pollen tube enters the embryo sac,
        and at the moment of fertilization and zygote/early endosperm activation.
        CRT mRNA and the protein localize mainly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
        and Golgi compartments of the cells, which are involved in sexual reproduction
        events, such as those in sister synergids, the egg cell, the central cell,
        zygote and the developing endosperm. Additionally, immunogold research demonstrates
        selective CRT distribution in the filiform apparatus (FA), a highly specific
        component of the synergid cell wall. In the light of our previous data showing
        the total transcriptional activity of the Hyacinthus female gametophyte and
        the results presented here, we discuss the possible functions of CRT with
        respect to the critical role of Ca^2+ homeostasis during key events of sexual
        plant reproduction. Moreover, we propose that the elevated expression of CRT
        within the female gametophyte is a universal phenomenon in the cells involved
        in double fertilization in higher plants.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00239-015-9697-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00239-015-9697-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00239-015-9697-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00239-015-9697-5\"}],\"title\":\"Reconstructed

        sequence reconstruction has been widely used to study historical enzyme evolution,
        both from biochemical and cellular perspectives. Two properties of reconstructed
        ancestral proteins/enzymes are commonly reported\u2014high thermostability
        and high catalytic activity\u2014compared with their contemporaries. Increased
        protein stability is associated with lower aggregation rates, higher soluble
        protein abundance and a greater capacity to evolve, and therefore, these proteins
        could be considered \u201Csuperior\u201D to their contemporary counterparts.
        In this study, we investigate the relationship between the favourable in vitro
        biochemical properties of reconstructed ancestral enzymes and the organismal
        fitness they confer in vivo. We have previously reconstructed several ancestors
        of the enzyme LeuB, which is essential for leucine biosynthesis. Our initial
        fitness experiments revealed that overexpression of ANC4, a reconstructed
        LeuB that exhibits high stability and activity, was only able to partially
        rescue the growth of a \u0394 leuB strain, and that a strain complemented
        with this enzyme was outcompeted by strains carrying one of its descendants.
        When we expanded our study to include five reconstructed LeuBs and one contemporary,
        we found that neither in vitro protein stability nor the catalytic rate was
        correlated with fitness. Instead, fitness showed a strong, negative correlation
        with estimated evolutionary age (based on phylogenetic relationships). Our
        findings suggest that, for reconstructed ancestral enzymes, superior in vitro
        properties do not translate into organismal fitness in vivo. The molecular
        basis of the relationship between fitness and the inferred age of ancestral
        LeuB enzymes is unknown, but may be related to the reconstruction process.
        We also hypothesise that the ancestral enzymes may be incompatible with the
        other, contemporary enzymes of the metabolic network.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/8623_2015_139\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/8623_2015_139\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/8623_2015_139\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/8623_2015_139\"}],\"title\":\"Flow

        presence of posttranslational modifications is a key feature for the biological
        activity and stability of many natural products, including lanthipeptides.
        Lanthipeptides are a group of posttranslationally modified peptides containing
        lanthionine residues in their structures. Among lanthipeptides, the subgroup
        of lantibiotics is receiving a renewed interest in the last years for their
        high antimicrobial activity. The development of production platforms for novel
        lantibiotics and peptides containing posttranslational modifications is taking
        place in parallel to the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of the enzymes
        responsible for these modifications. It is now possible to combine pieces
        (i.e., enzymes and regulatory elements) of different biosynthesis routes of
        natural products in order to modify peptides of interest in a predictable
        manner. In this chapter we detail the production of lanthipeptides and thioether-stabilized
        peptides using two well-established production platforms for Escherichia coli
        and Lactococcus lactis . These are based on the dehydration and cyclization
        reactions carried out by the enzymes NisB and NisC, respectively, on peptides
        fused to the nisin leader peptide. Furthermore, we provide appropriate protocols
        for the purification and characterization of the peptides produced and modified
        with these biosynthetic tools.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11764-015-0484-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11764-015-0484-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11764-015-0484-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11764-015-0484-5\"}],\"title\":\"Gender

        has been reported that cancer survivors are delaying or avoiding necessary
        care due to costs. Medication non-adherence is one of the important aspects
        of deferred treatment. This study estimates the prevalence of cost-related
        medication non-adherence (CRN) by gender and factors associated with CRN among
        cancer survivors.MethodsUsing 2006\u20132013 National Health Interview Survey
        (NHIS), we examined self-reported CRN among cancer survivors by gender. Descriptive
        statistics and multiple logistic regression models were used to examine gender
        differences in CRN.ResultsIn a nationally representative sample of 15,159
        cancer survivors, 7.4\_% of male and 12.5\_% of female reported CRN. Overall,
        the prevalence of CRN was found to be the highest for uninsured group and
        the lowest for Medicare, but gender differences persist for all insurance
        types, including Medicare. After controlling for relevant covariates, female
        cancer survivors were 27\_% more likely (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20091.27,
        confidence intervals (CI), 1.06\u20131.53) than male to report CRN. With higher
        number of comorbidities and activity limitations, CRN rates tend to increase
        for both male and female cancer survivors.ConclusionsSignificant gender differences
        in CRN were found among cancer survivors after controlling for differences
        in sociodemographic, health status, and insurance coverage.Implications for
        Cancer SurvivorsGiven the rapid increase in prescription drug costs, it is
        important to monitor closely the CRN in high-risk subgroups.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10933-015-9855-1\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10933-015-9855-1\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10933-015-9855-1\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-015-9855-1\"}],\"title\":\"Microscopic

        clay, organic-rich laminae, sand beds and buried soils. These buried soils
        range in thickness from 2 to 16\_cm and are composed of silty clay with varying
        degrees of root bioturbation and have a gray-green-bluish color. They could
        classify as Entisols and in this article we refer to them as paleosols. Samples
        from each of these sediment types (except sand), and samples from two modern-analog
        environments, also on the proximal part of the Cauca River, i.e. sediment
        from a seasonally flooded pond and the upper-most layer of a modern soil,

        and consent has been one of the most intensely discussed topics within the
        context of biobank research. In parallel to the normative debate, many socio-empirical
        studies have been conducted to gather experiences, preferences and views of
        patients, healthy research participants and further stakeholders. However,
        there is scarcity of literature which connects the normative debate about
        justifications for different consent models with findings gained in empirical
        research. In this paper we discuss findings of a limited review of socio-empirical
        research on patients\u2019 and healthy research participants\u2019 experiences
        and views regarding consent to biobank research in light of ethical principles
        for appropriate information and consent.MethodsReview question: Which empirical
        data are available on research participants\u2019 perceptions and views regarding
        information and elicitation of consent for biobank research? Search of articles
        published till March 1st 2014 in Pubmed. Review of abstracts and potentially
        relevant full text articles by two authors independently. As categories for
        content analysis we defined (i) understanding or recall of information, (ii)
        preferences regarding information or consent, and (iii) research participants\u2019
        concerns.ResultsThe search in Pubmed yielded 337 abstracts of which 10 articles
        were included in this study. Approaches to information and consent varied
        considerably across the selected studies. The majority of research participants
        opted for some version of limited consent when being informed about such possibility.
        Among the factors influencing the type of preferred consent were information
        about sponsoring of biobank research by pharmaceutical industry and participants\u2019
        trade-off between privacy and perceived utility. Studies investigating research
        participants\u2019 understanding and recall regarding the consent procedure
        indicated considerable lack of both aspects. Research participants\u2019 perceptions
        of benefits and harms differ across those studies.ConclusionThe knowledge,
        perceptions and views of research participants who have undergone a consent
        procedure within the context of biobank research raise several questions on
        the issue of how to inform and elicit consent in an ethically acceptable way.
        In our empirical-ethical analysis we develop suggestions on how the practice
        of eliciting consent in the biobank context should be improved.\"}],\"facets\":[{\"name\":\"subject\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"Medicine

        and examined for Entamoeba spp. and Giardia lamblia by PCR and genotyping.
        Twenty-seven samples, which were concentrated using the immunomagnetic separation
        technology (IMS) method, were examined for Giardia alone. Twenty-eight samples,
        which were concentrated using the sucrose flotation (SF) method, were examined
        for both Giardia and Entamoeba species. The results showed that 27/55 (17/27
        and 10/28) (49\_%), 4 /28 (14.28\_%) and 3/28 (10.7\_%) of the samples were
        positive for Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba spp and mixed infections ( Entamoeba
        spp . and Giardia spp.), respectively. Sixteen out of 55 samples were negative.
        Entamoeba genus-specific PCR primers in single-round PCR were used to differentiate
        between the Entamoeba spp. ( E. histolytica , E. dispar and E. moshkovskii)
        . With respect to the 7 samples that were positive for Entamoeba, (14.28\_%)
        4 out of 28 were positive for E. moshkovskii, (7.14\_%), 2 out of 28 were
        positive for E. histolytica and (3.57\_%) 1 out of 28 was positive for E.
        dispar. Genus-specific PCR primers in a semi-nested PCR assay was performed
        to genotype Giardia species. Of the 27 samples that were positive for Giardia
        , 10 samples were sequences. All 10 successfully sequenced samples contained
        assemblage B of Giardia lamblia . This is first study to investigate the G.
        lamblia genotypes in the water supply of the Tehran and Guilan provinces,
        and it is the first study to investigate Entamoeba species in the water supplies
        of Iran. The investigated river water supplies, which are used for agriculture,
        camping and animal farming, were heavily contaminated by the human pathogenic
        Entamoeba and Giardia parasites. There is a potential risk of waterborne outbreaks
        in humans and animals.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00261-015-0543-4\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00261-015-0543-4\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00261-015-0543-4\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00261-015-0543-4\"}],\"title\":\"Diagnostic

        2008 and October 2013 identified 10 patients (8\_M, 2\_F, mean age 61\_years,
        range 34\u201382) with a clinical diagnosis of IAC. Fifteen cases of PSC (6\_M,
        9\_F, mean age 50, range 22\u201365) and 15 cases of biliary malignancy (7\_M,
        8\_F, mean age 65, range 48\u201384) were randomly selected for comparative
        analysis. Three abdominal radiologists independently reviewed MRI with MRCP
        ( n \_=\_32) or CT ( n \_=\_8) and ERCP ( n \_=\_8) for the following IAC
        imaging predictors: single-wall bile duct thickness \\u003e2.5\_mm, continuous
        biliary involvement, gallbladder involvement, liver disease, peribiliary mass,
        or pancreatic and renal abnormalities. Each radiologist provided an imaging-based
        diagnosis (IAC, PSC, or cancer). Imaging predictor sensitivity, specificity,
        accuracy, and association with IAC using Fisher\u2019s exact test. Inter-reader
        agreement determined using Fleiss\u2019 kappa statistics.ResultsFor diagnosis
        of IAC, sensitivities and specificities were high (70\u201393%). Pancreatic
        abnormality was strongest predictor for distinguishing IAC from PSC and cancer,
        with high diagnostic performance (70\u201380% sensitivity, 87\u201397% specificity),
        significant association ( p \_\\u003c\_0.01), and moderate inter-reader agreement
        ( \u03BA \_=\_0.59). Continuous biliary involvement was moderately predictive
        (50\u2013100% sensitivity, 53\u201383% specificity) and trended toward significant
        association in distinguishing from PSC ( p \_=\_0.01\u20130.19), but less
        from cancer ( p \_=\_0.06\u20130.62).ConclusionIt remains difficult to distinguish
        IAC from PSC or bile duct malignancy based on imaging features alone. The
        presence of pancreatic abnormalities, including peripancreatic rind, atrophy,
        abnormal enhancement, or T2 signal intensity, strongly favors a diagnosis
        of IAC.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11243-015-9978-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11243-015-9978-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11243-015-9978-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11243-015-9978-2\"}],\"title\":\"Three

        MSCs were injected periurethrally or systemically into rats immediately after
        vaginal distention (VD) ( n \u2009=\u200990). Control groups were non-VD (uninjured/untreated,
        n \u2009=\u200915), local or systemic saline (injection/control, n \u2009=\u200990),
        and dermofibroblast (cell therapy/control, n \u2009=\u200990). Leak-point
        pressure (LPP) was measured 4, 10, and 14\_days later. Urethras were morphometrically
        evaluated. In another sets of VD and non-VD rats, the fate of periurethrally
        injected hMSC, biodistribution, and in vivo viability was studied using human
        Alu genomic repeat staining, PKH26 labeling, and luciferase-expression labeling,
        respectively.ResultsSaline- and dermofibroblast-treated control rats demonstrated
        lower LPP than non-VD controls at days 4 and 14 ( P \u2009\\u003c\u20090.01).
        LPP after systemic hMSC and periurethral hMSC treatment were comparable with
        non-VD controls at 4, 10, and 14\_days ( P \u2009\\u003e\u20090.05). Local
        saline controls demonstrated extensive urethral tissue bleeding. The connective
        tissue area/urethral section area proportion and vascular density were higher
        in the local hMSC- versus the saline-treated group at 4 and 14\_days, respectively.
        No positive Alu-stained nuclei were observed in urethras at 4, 10, and 14\_days.
        PKH26-labelled cells were found in all urethras at 2 and 24\_h. Bioluminescence
        study showed increased luciferase expression from day 0 to 1 following hMSC
        injection.ConclusionsHuman MSCs restored the continence mechanism with an
        immediate and sustained effect in the VD model, while saline and dermofibroblast
        therapy did not. Human MSCs remained at the site of periurethral injection
        for \\u003c7\_days. We hypothesize that periurethral hMSC treatment improves
        vascular, connective tissue, and hemorrhage status of urethral tissues after

        normally do not include interaction effects between different pools of recalcitrant
        humic organic carbon which can alter carbon cycling via their influence on
        biological activities. This issue is especially important in northern regions
        where lakes receive high inputs of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon
        (DOC) from the extensive surrounding peatlands. We investigated the threshold
        of added labile DOC necessary to promote a priming effect (PE); i.e. stimulation
        of bacterial metabolism with a subsequent increase in the mineralization of
        recalcitrant DOC and the accompanying changes in microbial community structure
        and function. Our study was carried out in a small highly humic lake (Mekkoj\xE4rvi,
        southern Finland), physically divided by a plastic curtain into two experimental
        basins, one where fish were present (+FISH) and one that was fishless (\u2212FISH).
        In each basin, we performed a factorial mesocosm experiment in which different
        amounts of labile DOC were supplied as cane sugar (control +6, +9, +12\_mg\_C\_L^\u22121).
        Our results showed no priming effect in any carbon treatment, either in +FISH
        or in \u2212FISH basins, despite a decreasing trend in total DOC concentration.
        Bacterial abundance and production did not increase as a response to carbon
        additions, while mixotrophic algae increased their abundance over time. In
        our experiments, the organisms that benefitted most after addition of labile
        DOC were mixotrophic algae, which can transform carbon into biomass by obtaining
        inorganic nutrients through phagotrophy. This appears most likely due to strong
        bacterial N limitation and dependence on resource availability and stoichiometry.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s13047-015-0104-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s13047-015-0104-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13047-015-0104-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13047-015-0104-7\"}],\"title\":\"Intra-rater

        droplets have found widespread applications in various engineering and biomedical
        fields because of their capability in encapsulating different components in
        each layer. The conventional double-emulsion method is the two-stage stirring
        emulsification method, which suffers from poor monodispersity and low encapsulation
        efficiency. With recent advances in microfabrication, some novel methods for
        fabricating double-emulsion droplets have been developed, including microfluidic
        emulsification (double-T-junction microchannel, double-cross-shaped microchannel
        and several three-dimensional microchannels), membrane emulsification and

        schistosome and soil-transmitted nematode infections are frequently reported
        in human populations living in tropical areas of developing countries. In
        addition to exposure factors, the host immune response plays an important
        role in helminth control and morbidity in hosts with multiple infections;
        however, these aspects are difficult to evaluate in human populations. In
        the current study, female Swiss mice were simultaneously co-infected with
        Strongyloides venezuelensis and Schistosoma mansoni or infected with St. venezuelensis
        at 2, 4, or 14\_weeks after Sc. mansoni infection. The simultaneously infected
        mice showed a similar parasite burden for St. venezuelensis compared with
        mono-infected mice. In contrast, there was a significant reduction of St.
        venezuelensis burden (primarily during the migration of the larvae) in mice
        that were previously infected with Sc. mansoni at the acute or chronic phase.
        Independent of the stage of Sc. mansoni infection, the St. venezuelensis co-infection
        was capable of inducing IL-4 production in the small intestine, increasing
        the IgE concentration in the serum and increasing eosinophilia in the lungs
        and intestine. This result suggests that the nematode infection stimulates
        local type 2 immune responses independently of the schistosomiasis stage.
        Moreover, previous Sc. mansoni infection stimulated early granulocyte infiltration
        in the lungs and trematode-specific IgM and IgG1 production that recognized
        antigens from St. venezuelensis infective larvae; these immune responses would
        act in the early control of St. venezuelensis larvae. Our data suggest that
        the effect of multiple helminth infections on host susceptibility and morbidity
        largely depends on the species of parasite and the immune response.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11605-015-2936-7\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11605-015-2936-7\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11605-015-2936-7\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11605-015-2936-7\"}],\"title\":\"Placement

        The Author(s)\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractThe Afghanistan population
        living far from rivers relies upon groundwater delivered from karezes (sub-horizontal
        tunnels). Karezes exploit unconfined groundwater in alluvial fans recharged
        largely by snowmelt from the Hindu Kush, the central mountain range of the
        country. Since the multi-year drought that began in 1998, many karezes have
        stopped flowing. This study characterizes the hydraulics of a kariz, the potential
        for reduced groundwater recharge because of climate change, and the impact
        of increasing population on kariz water production. A typical kariz in Afghanistan
        is 1\u20132\_km long with a cross-section of 1\u20132\_m^2 and gradient of
        1\_m\_km^\u22121. MODFLOW simulations show that water delivery from a kariz
        can be modeled by imposing a high ratio of kariz hydraulic conductivity to
        aquifer hydraulic conductivity on the cells representing the kariz. The model
        is sensitive to hydraulic conductivity, kariz gradient, and length of the
        kariz in contact with the water table. Precipitation data are scarce in Afghanistan,
        but regional data show a long-term trend of decreased snow cover, and therefore
        strong likelihood of decreased aquifer recharge. Population in Afghanistan
        has increased at a rate of about 2.2\_% over the past several decades. An
        assessment of a six-district region within Kandahar Province where karezes
        are the most likely source of water indicates that water demand could have
        caused water tables to decline by 0.8\u20135.6\_m, more than enough to cause
        karezes to stop flowing. These results suggest that kariz water production

        Tijuana, Mexico, HIV is concentrated in sub-epidemics of key populations:
        persons who inject drugs (PWID), sex workers (SW), and men who have sex with
        men (MSM). To date, data on engagement in the HIV care continuum among these
        key populations, particularly in resource-constrained settings, are sparse.
        We pooled available epidemiological data from six studies (N\_=\_3368) to
        examine HIV testing and treatment uptake in these key populations; finding
        an overall HIV prevalence of 5.7\_%. Of the 191 identified HIV-positive persons,
        only 11.5\_% knew their HIV-positive status and 3.7\_% were on ART. Observed
        differences between these HIV-positive key populations suggest PWID (vs. non-PWID)
        were least likely to have previously tested or initiate HIV care. MSM (vs.
        non-MSM) were more likely to have previously tested but not more likely to
        know their HIV-positive status. Of persons aware of their HIV-positive status,
        SW (vs. non-SW) were more likely to initiate HIV care. Findings suggest engagement
        of key populations in HIV treatment is far below estimates observed for similarly
        resource-constrained generalized epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. These data
        provide one of the first empirical-snapshots highlighting the extent of HIV
        treatment disparities in key populations.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12134-015-0457-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12134-015-0457-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12134-015-0457-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12134-015-0457-6\"}],\"title\":\"Hope

        classified as a leukotriene (LT), a group of lipid mediators that are derived
        from arachidonic acid. It is recognized that leukotrienes are involved in
        the pathogenesis of many diseases, including peripheral inflammatory pain.
        However, little is known about the effects of leukotrienes on the spinal dorsal
        horn during neuropathic pain. Previously, we reported that there was increased
        expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) at spinal microglia, and the leukotriene
        B4 receptor 1 (BLT1), a high affinity receptor of LTB4, in spinal neurons
        in spared nerve injury (SNI) model rats. In the present study, we examined
        the effects of LTB4 on spinal dorsal horn neurons in both na\xEFve and SNI
        model rats using patch-clamp methods.ResultsBath application of LTB4 did not
        change AMPA receptor-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents
        (sEPSCs) or membrane potentials. However, we found that LTB4 enhanced the
        amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated sEPSCs and significantly increased exogenous
        NMDA-induced inward currents in SNI model rats. This increase of inward currents
        could be inhibited by a selective LTB4 antagonist, U75302, as well as a GDP-\u03B2-S,
        a G-protein inhibitor. These results indicate that both increased LTB4 from
        spinal microglia or increased BLT1 in spinal neurons after peripheral nerve
        injury can enhance the activity of NMDA receptors through intracellular G-proteins
        in spinal dorsal horn neurons.ConclusionOur findings showed that LTB4, which
        may originate from microglia, can activate BLT1 receptors which are expressed
        on the membrane of spinal dorsal horn neurons during neuropathic pain. This
        glia-neuron interaction induces the enhancement of NMDA currents through intracellular
        G-proteins. The enhancement of NMDA receptor sensitivity of dorsal horn neurons
        may lead to central sensitization, leading to mechanical pain hypersensitivity.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1245/s10434-015-4843-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1245/s10434-015-4843-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1245/s10434-015-4843-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1245/s10434-015-4843-2\"}],\"title\":\"Intraoperative

        (pHPT). This study examined age-related variability in abnormal parathyroid
        gland localization for targeted PTX and the value of IPM across age groups.MethodsA
        retrospective review examined prospectively collected data of 833 patients
        who underwent targeted PTX guided by IPM. The patients were stratified into
        three age groups as follows: younger [\\u003c47\_years; mean \u22121 standard
        deviation (SD)], typical (47\u201373\_years), and older (\\u003e73\_years;

        and positive predictive value (PPV) for MIBI, SUS, and IPM were analyzed and

        6\_months or longer after PTX, and operative failure was defined as elevated
        calcium and PTH levels within 6\_months after PTX.ResultsOf the 833 patients,
        the youngest group had the highest accuracy and sensitivity for MIBI, SUS,
        and IPM compared with the older groups ( p \_\\u003c\_0.05). The accuracy

        and acceptability of PROMIS measures in an addiction medicine setting.MethodsAs
        part of a 3-month prospective observational study, 225 outpatients at a substance
        abuse treatment clinic completed PROMIS item banks for alcohol use (as well
        as 15 additional item banks from 8 other PROMIS domains, including emotional

        importance ratings revealed that depression, anxiety, and lack of emotional

        reporting agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emission data from tropical upland
        crops or the climate adaptation and mitigation potential of farming practices
        that involve nutrient management and/or organic farming are very limited in
        number. We developed alternate groundnut ( Arachis hypogaea L.) farming practices
        for rainfed kharif (South-west monsoon) and irrigated rabi (winter) cropping
        seasons for agro-ecological region 3.0 in semi-arid peninsular India; and
        compared their yields, farm income as well as nitrous oxide (N_2O) emissions
        with current baseline practices among regional small scale farm-holders. At
        the study farm, alternate practices including application of locally prepared
        fermented manures along with a 40\u201360\_% reduction in application of total
        N increased pod yield by 50 and 35\_% and net profit by ~120 and ~70\_% in
        a drought-hit kharif and an irrigated rabi , respectively. High resolution

        for groundnut cultivation using baseline and alternate practices were 1.7\u20132.0\_%

        of 1 and 0.58\_%, respectively, underestimate GHG emissions during groundnut
        cultivation. Crucially, alternate practices led to (1) a reduction of 0.13\_\xB1\_0.07

        research has documented the continued existence of an expectation gap, defined
        as the divergence between the public\u2019s and the profession\u2019s conceptions
        of auditor\u2019s duties, despite the auditing profession\u2019s attempt to
        adopt standards and practices to close this gap. In this paper, we consider
        one potential explanation for the persistence of the expectation gap: the
        role of media bias in shaping public opinion and views. We analyze press articles
        covering 40 U.S. corporate fraud cases discovered between 1992 and 2011. We
        compare the auditor\u2019s duties, described by the auditing standards, with
        the description of the fraud cases as found in the press articles. We draw
        upon prior research to identify three sources of the expectation gap: deficient
        performance, deficient standards, and unreasonable expectations. The results
        of our analysis provide evidence that (1) the performance gap can be reduced
        by strengthening auditor\u2019s willingness and ability to apply existing
        auditing standards concerning fraud detection; (2) the standards gap can be
        narrowed by improving existing auditing standards; and (3) unreasonable expectations,
        however, involve elements beyond the profession\u2019s sphere of control.
        As a result, the expectation gap is unlikely to disappear given the media\u2019s
        tendency to bias, with an overemphasis of unreasonable expectations in their
        coverage of frauds and press articles tending to reinforce the view that the
        auditor should take more responsibility for detecting fraud, irrespective
        of whether this is feasible at a reasonable cost. In addition to the primary
        role of the press in perpetuating the expectation gap, a second reason for
        continuation of the expectation gap is that the rational auditor will have
        difficulty in assessing subjective components of fraudulent behavior.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11590-015-0945-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11590-015-0945-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11590-015-0945-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11590-015-0945-9\"}],\"title\":\"Small

        of women who presented to the ED with abdominal pain and received both a contrast-enhanced
        CT and CDU within a 24-h period. The abdominal/pelvic CT examinations were
        evaluated for findings specific to torsion, including ovarian size greater
        than 5\_cm, the presence of free fluid, uterine deviation, fallopian tube
        thickening, ovarian fat stranding, smooth wall thickening, the presence of
        the \u201Ctwisted pedicle\u201D sign, and abnormal ovarian enhancement. The
        results were compared to the presence or absence of ovarian torsion on the
        concurrent US.ResultsThe initial query yielded 834 cases among 789 women.
        Of those 834 cases, 283 cases in 261 women received both imaging modalities
        within a 24-h period. The CT examinations demonstrated 48 cases with an ovarian
        size greater than 5\_cm. 84 cases showed the presence of free fluid. Three
        cases of fallopian tube thickening were identified. One case of smooth wall
        thickening and a \u201Ctwisted pedicle\u201D sign were noted. Fifteen cases
        demonstrated stranding of the peri-ovarian fat. Twenty nine cases showed abnormal
        ovarian enhancement. A total of 111 cases showed at least one positive finding.
        Fourteen positive cases were identified on the CDU studies. Of the 14 positive
        cases, 11 had ovarian size greater than 5\_cm. Twelve cases demonstrated the
        presence of free fluid. There was no uterine deviation or smooth wall thickening.
        One twisted pedicle was noted. Seven cases showed peri-ovarian fat stranding.
        Ten cases showed abnormal enhancement. Abnormalities on CT were noted in all
        cases suspicious for ovarian torsion on CDU. No negative CT examinations were
        associated with a positive CDU. In this small sample size, the negative predictive
        value of a negative CT examination was 100%.ConclusionA negative contrast-enhanced
        CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis is sufficient to rule out ovarian
        torsion. Therefore, there is no utility in the addition of CDU specifically
        to evaluate for ovarian torsion following a negative contrast-enhanced CT
        scan of the abdomen and pelvis.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1208/s12248-015-9826-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1208/s12248-015-9826-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1208/s12248-015-9826-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1208/s12248-015-9826-5\"}],\"title\":\"Pharmacokinetics

        situ generation of reagents and their subsequent use downstream presents new
        opportunities to amplify the utility of nanofluidic devices by exploiting
        the confined geometry to address mass transport limitations on reaction kinetics
        and efficiency. Oxygen, an inherently valuable reactant, can be produced from
        electrolysis of water, a process that can be conveniently integrated within
        a nanofluidic system. Here, we construct and characterize a nanofluidic device
        consisting of a planar microband electrode embedded within a nanochannel for
        in situ electrochemical generation and optical monitoring of O_2. Fluorescein,
        a dye with a pH-sensitive emission intensity, was used to monitor the spatiotemporal
        characteristics of the oxidation of H_2O, using the co-produced H^+. Application
        of anodic potentials at the nanochannel-embedded electrode results in a decrease
        in fluorescence intensity, which reflects the decreasing solution pH. A combination
        of fluorescence intensity and chronoamperometric response was used to quantitatively
        determine proton generation, and the H^+/O_2 stoichiometry was then used to
        determine the concentration of the O_2 in the channel. Comparison of the experimental
        results to finite element simulations validates the use of fluorescein emission

        real-world problems are multimodal, which means algorithms should have the
        ability to find all or most of the multiple solutions as opposed to a single
        best solution. Niching is the technique that can help evolutionary algorithms
        to find multiple solutions. Attraction basin sphere estimation (ABSE) is a
        newly proposed niching method which has the power of inferring the shape of
        fitness landscapes by spending some extra evaluations. However, when we apply
        ABSE to genetic algorithms, those extra evaluations lead to an efficiency
        problem. However, we notice that the combination of ABSE and covariance matrix

        a good performance. This paper implements this idea and performs experiments
        on a benchmark set provided by CEC 2013 niching methods competition. The algorithm
        is compared with the best 5 algorithms in the competition. The results show
        that the proposed algorithm obtains a good result. The features of the proposed

        However, fishing pressure is intense during peak season, and tarpon fishing
        varies in time and space throughout the state. In this study, a novel method
        of obtaining fish tissue replaced traditional fin clipping, and citizen-scientists
        were utilized to collect DNA samples and record capture information from tarpon
        they caught. Benefits of using citizen scientists included being able to sample
        fish statewide and collect data on a species that is difficult to catch in
        great number. From the pilot study in 2005 through the study\u2019s end in
        2014, 24,572 samples were received from volunteer anglers throughout the coastal
        southeastern United States, and of those, 22,992 were collected from tarpon

        the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts and Florida Keys, but regionally the database
        was depauperate in samples from north Florida. Public outreach was a critical

        cannot rely on just one treatment technique, so research in this field has
        attracted much attention to satisfy stringent recovery and emissions standards

        a transcription factor involved in the regulation of organogenesis of the

        epithelial tumors of thyroid and parathyroid glands, kidney, thymus, and female
        genital tract. PAX8 is increasingly used in the establishment of tissue of
        origin in carcinomas and has recently been identified in a subset of small
        blue round cell tumors including Ewing sarcomas/PNETs. However, it is unclear
        if this association in ES/PNETs is due to renal origin or is PNET specific.
        In this study we investigated the PAX8 staining pattern of primary renal and
        extra-renal ES/PNETs to explore its potential diagnostic and prognostic role.
        A tissue microarray (TMA) of 22 cases of extra-renal Ewing/PNETs and two separate
        cases of primary renal PNET whole slide sections were immunohistochemically
        stained with rabbit polyclonal PAX8 antibody. PAX8 was positive in 2 of 2

        studies are warranted to verify these findings and to shed light in the tumorigenesis

        gas emissions by vehicle traffic should be reduced not only through innovations
        in automotive technology but also through a modal shift to sustainable transport.
        The modal shift to sustainable transport corresponding to the transport policy,
        as well as the purchase of clean energy vehicles (CEV) is regarded as the
        mobility shift. Therefore, both service improvement for sustainable transport
        modes, such as the bus rapid transit system, and economic incentive policies
        are considered in transport policy. Conversely, as the local community influences
        decisions on mobility shift, the estimation of CO_2 emissions should describe
        local interaction. Particularly, heterogeneity of local interaction should
        be described in the modeling of the mobility shift. Therefore, the mobility
        shift is modeled to incorporate heterogeneity and local interaction to estimate
        the effect of transport policies in reducing CO_2 emissions. The research
        question is how much do heterogeneity and local interaction influence mobility
        shift with the policy for sustainable transport. A multi-agent mobility shift
        simulation model that considers heterogeneity and local interaction is developed.
        For this purpose, the stated preference for mode change and purchase CEV policies
        is investigated via a questionnaire survey. The proposed multi-agent simulation
        model includes the decision process of the agent regarding mobility shift,
        the social influence process in the social network, and the CO_2 emission
        process. The decision process for commuting mode is modeled using the hierarchical
        Bayesian method mainly to describe the heterogeneity of the influence of the
        local mode share. The day-to-day dynamics of commuting mode choice and the
        purchase of CEVs corresponding to the transport policy are estimated using
        the proposed multi-agent simulation model. The results confirm that the heterogeneity
        of influence on social conformity should be considered in the modeling of
        modal shift as both conformity effects and non-conformity effects are observed.
        However, the assumption of homogeneous commuters might cause estimates that
        are too high, since the heterogeneity of commuters decreases the share of
        the sustainable transport mode. Furthermore, the green tax policy is confirmed
        to be suitable for maximizing the reduction rate of CO_2 emissions, as pricing
        based on fuel consumption maximizes reduction efficiency.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s12906-015-0828-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s12906-015-0828-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s12906-015-0828-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-015-0828-8\"}],\"title\":\"Decreased

        National Health Insurance Research Database was used to conduct a retrospective
        cohort study of 23475 stroke patients aged 40\u201379 years receiving acupuncture
        treatment and 46950 propensity score-matched stroke patients not receiving
        acupuncture treatment who served as controls from 2000 to 2004. Both stroke
        cohorts were followed until the end of 2009 and were adjusted for immortal
        time to measure the incidence and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\_%
        confidence intervals (CIs) for new-onset AMI in multivariate Cox proportional
        hazard models.ResultsStroke patients who received acupuncture treatment (9.2
        per 1000 person-years) exhibited a lower incidence of AMI compared with those
        who did not receive acupuncture treatment (10.8 per 1000 person-years), with
        an HR of 0.86 (95\_% CI, 0.80\u20130.93) after adjusting for age, sex, low
        income, coexisting medical conditions and medications. The relationship between
        acupuncture treatment and AMI risk was investigated in female stroke patients

        increased malignancy, lung cancer can be classified into adenocarcinoma (ADC),
        squamous cell carcinoma (SQC), large cell carcinoma (LCC), and the small cell
        subtype (SCLC); yet, elucidations to this augmented malignancy has not been
        addressed. In this study, we elucidated the molecular diversity among these
        subtypes by investigating large-scale sequencing datasets. Among genes upregulated
        from normal, ADC, SQC, LCC to SCLC, six hub genes were found closely correlated
        with adverse clinical outcome and were testified on cellular or tissue level
        with quantitative RT-PCR. Cox regression model was then built to generate
        a risk signature. The possible linkages among these genes were also explored.
        Transcript levels of BUB1, E2F1, ESPL1, GTSE1, RAB3B, and U2AF2 were found
        significantly elevated from normal, ADC, SQC, LCC to SCLC. Overexpression
        of one or multiple of these genes was correlated with adverse overall survival
        (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in the whole patient cohort or groups
        stratified according to clinical variables, while most of all six genes were
        independent prognostic factors. When used as a six-gene risk signature, patients
        with high signature score displayed more unfavorable clinical variables and
        poorer outcome. Tight regulative relationships were found within these genes,
        while BUB1 and E2F1 were likely to be the drivers. We considered the augmented
        malignancy from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to SCLC might be due to
        the elevation of these six genes. We believe these genes were powerful cancer

        (IOP) 5 on 20 April 2013) compares well with what is considered typical CBL
        behaviour, the second case (from IOP 6 on 24 April 2013) shows a number of

        wind shear across the CBL top. However, a major difference between both cases
        is the advection of a humid layer above the CBL top during IOP 6. While the
        variance profile of IOP 5 shows a maximum at the interfacial layer, two variance
        peaks are observed near the CBL top for IOP 6. A marked difference can also

        the most widespread hydrous metasomatic phases in spinel-bearing mantle peridotites
        from Harrow Peaks (HP), Northern Victoria Land (Antarctica). They occur both
        in veinlets and disseminated in the peridotite matrix (preferentially associated
        with clinopyroxene and spinel grains). Four amphibole crystals were investigated
        by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD), electron microprobe analysis
        (EMPA), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and micro-M\xF6ssbauer spectroscopy;
        these crystal-chemical data allow to constrain upper mantle conditions during
        growth of these amphiboles and the role of volatile circulation during metasomatic
        processes in the Antarctic region. The HP amphiboles have low Mg# values (69.3\u201384.1),
        high TiO_2 (2.74\u20135.30\_wt%) and FeO_tot contents (3.40 to 6.90\_wt%).
        The Fe^3+/Fe_tot ratios are significantly high (0.53\u20130.66). The W-site
        is mainly occupied by O^2- (0.984\u20131.187 apfu) plus OH (H_2O: 0.70\u20131.01\_wt%)
        and minor F (0.04\u20130.24\_wt%) and Cl (0.03\u20130.08\_wt%). Consequently,
        HP amphiboles are actually characterized by a significant oxo component. The
        a H_2O values were calculated at 1.5\_GPa by dehydration equilibrium equations
        written as H_2O-buffering equilibria among end-member components of amphibole
        and coexisting peridotite phases. Three out of four HP amphibole-bearing peridotites
        have values of a H_2O ranging from 0.122 to 0.335; whereas one sample has
        a H_2O remarkably higher (0.782) approaching an ideal H_2O basalt solubility.
        The HP f O_2 values, determined by the olivine-spinel-orthopyroxene oxygeobarometer
        (\u0394QFM\u2009=\u2009\u22121.77 : +0.01), are remarkably different from
        those calculated on the basis of the amphibole dehydration equilibrium and
        the application of the dissociation reaction (\u0394QFM\u2009=\u2009\u22122.60
        : +6.8). The high a H_2O and the extremely high f O_2 values, determined by
        the oxy-amphibole equilibrium with respect to the redox conditions recorded
        by the co-existing anhydrous minerals (close to QFM buffer), revealed that:
        i) the amphibole-forming reaction is a relatively recent process with the
        new phases far from having reached a potential equilibrium with the peridotite
        matrix; ii) amphibole seems to be formed by the precipitation of migrating
        H_2O-rich melts with a negligible contribution of the peridotite system.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10529-015-1951-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10529-015-1951-9\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10529-015-1951-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-015-1951-9\"}],\"title\":\"Enhancing

        Society (DGK) proposes, in agreement with the Saxony-Anhalt Medical Chamber,
        criteria for regulating specialist training in internal medicine and cardiology
        and for authorization of training cardiologists. In general, the institution
        which trains cardiologists should perform treatment of at least 1000 patients
        with cardiovascular disorders annually and the training supervisor as well
        as the deputy should be certified cardiologists. A hospital cardiologist having
        authorization for the full 36-month cardiology training should enable the
        trainee to gain expertise in the full spectrum of cardiology, authorization
        for 24 months training necessitates a cardiac catherization laboratory in
        the hospital and authorization for 12 months in a hospital or in a cardiac
        rehabilitation clinic depends on the routine non-interventional cardiac treatment
        of patients. In analogy, cardiologists in private practice can obtain teaching
        authorization for 12 months (standard outpatient cardiac treatment) or 18
        months (by additionally having access to a cardiac catherization facility).
        Cooperation and network contracts can enlarge the authorized teaching spectrum.
        With these recommendations the DGK wants to outline the mandatory requirements
        for speciality training in cardiology, contribute to the quality of regulated
        specialist cardiology training and improve cooperation in cardiac training
        with the German Medical Chambers.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3143-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3143-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11661-015-3143-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11661-015-3143-6\"}],\"title\":\"Application

        the basis of Eyring\u2019s theory of absolute reaction rate, an approach to
        modeling Si particle refinement acceleration in the semi-solid forming of
        a hypereutectic Al-Si alloy has been developed. The acceleration variable
        data used in the present analysis were obtained from a semi-solid compression
        test using Al-25\_mass\_pct Si alloy cylindrical specimens with a diameter
        of 15\_mm and a height of 15\_mm; the test conditions comprised a combination
        of compression displacements \u2206 h \_=\_5, 10, and 12\_mm; compression
        rates v \_=\_5, 25, and 125\_mm/min; and test temperatures T \_=\_853\_K and
        863\_K (580\_\xB0C and 590\_\xB0C). The coarse primary Si particle refinement
        depends on a complex interaction among variables, such as compression displacement,
        compression rate, and test temperature. The performance of Si particle refinement
        degraded under higher temperature, slower strain rates, and slower shear rates.
        The results of the Si particle size are suitably summarized by the Eyring
        equation as a function of the temperature and the shear rate. The baseline
        Si particle size and the baseline temperature of Si particle refinement, i.e.
        , the reference temperature, were G _N\_=\_0.27\_mm and T _N\_=\_866.4\_K
        (593.4\_\xB0C), respectively. The calculated results using this equation correlated
        well with the observed results. An acceleration factor of Si particle refinement
        was successfully derived on the basis of this equation and indicated that
        operating at a higher shear rate and a temperature just above the melting
        point of eutectic Al-Si alloy are the optimum conditions for refining Si particles.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s40011-015-0640-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40011-015-0640-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40011-015-0640-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40011-015-0640-8\"}],\"title\":\"Identification

        hormones (THs) play an important role in many physiological functions both
        in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. The effect of THs is mediated
        by thyroid hormone receptors, which are members of nuclear hormone receptor
        super family. cDNA sequence of 816\_bp mRNA of Thyroid stimulating hormone
        receptor (TSHR) was cloned from Clarias batrachus, which encoded a peptide
        of 272 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity
        to Clarias gariepinus and Ictalurus punctatus. Phylogenetic analysis of C.
        batrachus deduced amino acid sequence showed more similarity with C. gariepinus
        and I. punctatus. The qPCR result displayed that TSHR mRNA was highly expressed
        in brain, testis and ovary. mRNA expression level of TSHR was analysed after
        administration of three different dosages of sLHRH viz 0.02, 0.03 and 0.050\_\u03BCg/g

        of TSHR mRNA in gonads and upregulation of THSR mRNA expression level after

        the study lies in the use of our non-rabbit-derived strain (AL41\u2009=\u2009CCM8558)
        which produces new enterocin M. Ninety-six post -weaned rabbits (Hyplus breed)
        aged 5\_weeks were divided into three experimental groups, 24 in each: E.
        senticosus (ES, 30\_g/100\_kg) in feed, E. faecium AL41 (10^9\_CFU/mL marked
        by rifampicin to differentiate it from other enterococci) in water, and ES\u2009+\u2009AL.
        AL41 colonized sufficiently in rabbits to reduce coliforms, staphylococci,
        pseudomonads and clostridia. Slight decrease in bacteria was also found in
        the caecum and appendix. Phagocytic activity was significantly increased in
        the experimental groups compared to the control group (CG) ( p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.001;
        p \u2009\\u003c\u20090.05). Applications did not evoke oxidative stress. Biochemical
        parameters in blood and caecal organic acids were slightly influenced. Average
        daily weight gain was slightly higher in ES and AL\u2009+\u2009ES. Combinative
        application of E. faecium with E. senticosus can be beneficial in rabbits.
        AL41 strain alone and in combination with ES produced reduction in spoilage
        bacteria; the highest stimulation of PA was in the AL41\u2009+\u2009ES group.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11739-015-1301-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11739-015-1301-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11739-015-1301-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11739-015-1301-x\"}],\"title\":\"Ultrasound

        method to simulate orthotropic behaviour in thin shell finite elements is
        proposed. The approach is based on the transformation of shape function derivatives,
        resulting in a new orthogonal basis aligned to a specified preferred direction
        for all elements. This transformation is carried out solely in the undeformed
        state leaving minimal additional impact on the computational effort expended
        to simulate orthotropic materials compared to isotropic, resulting in a straightforward
        and highly efficient implementation. This method is implemented for rotation-free
        triangular shells using the finite element framework built on the Kirchhoff\u2013Love
        theory employing subdivision surfaces. The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated
        using the deformation of a pinched hemispherical shell (with a $$18^{\\\\circ
        }$$ 18 \u2218 hole) standard benchmark. To showcase the efficiency of this
        implementation, the wrinkling of orthotropic sheets under shear displacement
        is analyzed. It is found that orthotropic subdivision shells are able to capture
        the wrinkling behavior of sheets accurately for coarse meshes without the
        use of an additional wrinkling model.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13147-015-0358-3\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13147-015-0358-3\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13147-015-0358-3\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13147-015-0358-3\"}],\"title\":\"B\xF6schen,

        McNally et al.\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractBackgroundVitamin D
        is a pleiotropic hormone important for the recovery of organ systems after
        critical illness. Recent observational studies have suggested that three out
        of every four children are vitamin D deficient following cardiac surgery,
        with inadequate preoperative intake and surgical losses playing important
        contributory roles. Observed associations between postoperative levels, cardiovascular
        dysfunction and clinical course suggest that perioperative optimization of
        vitamin D status could improve outcome. With this two-arm, parallel, double
        blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aim to compare immediate postoperative
        vitamin D status in children requiring cardiopulmonary bypass for congenital
        heart disease who receive preoperative daily high dose vitamin D supplementation
        (high-dose arm) with those who receive usual intake (low-dose arm).Methods/DesignEligibility
        requirements include age (\\u003e36 weeks, \\u003c18 years) and a congenital
        heart defect requiring cardiopulmonary bypass surgical correction. Enrollment
        of 62 participants will take place at a single Canadian tertiary care center
        over a period of 2 years. Children randomized to the high-dose group will
        receive age-based dosing that was informed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM)
        daily tolerable upper intake level (\\u003c1 year old = 1,600 IU/day, \\u003e1
        year old = 2,400 IU/day). Children in the low-dose arm will receive usual
        care based on IOM recommendations (\\u003c1 year old = 400 IU, \\u003e1 year
        old = 600 IU). The primary outcome measure is immediate postoperative vitamin
        D status, using blood 25(OH)D.DiscussionMaintaining adequate postoperative
        vitamin D levels following surgery could represent an effective therapy to
        speed recovery following CHD surgery. The proposed research project will determine
        whether preoperative supplementation with a dosing regimen based on the IOM
        recommended daily upper tolerable intake will prevent postoperative vitamin-D
        deficiency in the majority of children. The results will then be used to inform
        the design of a large international RCT exploring whether preoperative optimization
        of vitamin D status might improve short and long-term outcomes in this vulnerable

        Indian Association of Cardiovascular-Thoracic Surgeons\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractBackgroundRheumatic
        heart disease remains a major health problem in developing countries in which
        mitral stenosis (MS) is the most common sequela of it. Its consequences are
        pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, thromboembolism (TE), heart failure,
        and if untreated death ensues. The management of MS varies depending on severity
        of disease, availability of expertise, and resource; however, in a facility-deprived
        country with low economic status, closed mitral valvotomy remains the standard
        palliative treatment. Closed mitral valvotomy (CMV) is indicated in patients
        with pure, non-calcific isolated MS with normal sinus rhythm. We believe that
        although the procedure seems identical, CMV is a more controlled method than
        percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV), which is proven by more
        successful results and less incidence of complications related to embolization
        and mitral valve regurgitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
        clinical status of patients with mitral stenosis following closed mitral valvotomy.
        About 96\_% of the patients were in good health. These results suggest that
        there is still a good place for closed mitral valvotomy in carefully selected
        cases.Materials and methodsData obtained over a 20-year period from August
        1995 to August 2014, from 4341 patients who underwent CMV were analyzed. The
        analysis was carried out retrospectively and prospectively from hospital records,
        with follow-up examinations being conducted mainly at the outpatient clinic.
        The suitable patients were selected according to echocardiography criteria:
        (1) pliable anterior mitral leaflet, (2) absence of significant mitral subvalvular
        disease, (3) absence of significant calcification, and (4) the mitral valve
        orifice area less than (1.1\_cm^2). The indications also include asymptomatic
        women of child-bearing age with mitral valve areas of \u223C1.2\_cm^2. The
        presence of left atrial thrombus, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation
        (MR), leaflet calcification \\u003e2, and severe subvalvular fibrosis \\u003e2
        constitute an absolute contraindication for the procedure.ResultsIn-hospital
        mortality (\u226430\_days after surgery) was 0.5\_% ( n \u2009=\u200922, all
        closed procedures). Cardiac failure with significant MR was the main cause
        of early death, and no postoperative peripheral embolism occurred in cases
        done after transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and occurred in 0.5\_% cases
        done without TEE. We performed TEE in all cases after the year 2000. Freedom
        from thromboembolism was 99.0\u2009\xB1\u20090.5\_% at 20\_years. Operative
        results were satisfactory in most patients, and severe mitral incompetence
        was seen only in hundred cases in which 15 cases converted to open heart and
        remaining treated with medical treatment in which we lost 12 patients. Postvalvotomy
        moderate mitral regurgitation occurred in 720 patients (16.58\_%) during the
        first year after CMV. Reoperation was performed in 1110 patients (25.57\_%).
        The mean interval between CMV and reoperation was 141.1\u2009\xB1\u200960.8\_months
        (range 1\u2013240\_months). Hundred patients were reoperated for moderate
        or severe mitral regurgitation, 990 for mitral restenosis, and 20 for mixed
        mitral valve disease (stenosis and regurgitation). Freedom from reoperation
        after CMV was 81.4\u2009\xB1\u20091.3\_% at 10\_years and 74.42\u2009\xB1\u20092.1\_%
        at 20\_years. Cox regression analysis indicated that impaired functional capacity,
        reduced mitral valve area, gradual increase in left atrial diameter, and postoperative
        mitral insufficiency increased the reoperation rate after CMV.ConclusionThere
        was an overall highly significant improvement in clinical stage of the disease:
        reduction in mean pressure gradient across the mitral valve and reduction
        in pulmonary hypertension and mean left atrial size. Similarly, there was
        improvement in ventricular function in terms of ejection fraction and increase
        in mean mitral valve area. When compared with percutaneous balloon or surgical
        open valvotomy, CMV represents a satisfactory technique in terms of lower
        cost, high efficacy, simplicity, and reproducibility.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11235-015-0087-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11235-015-0087-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11235-015-0087-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11235-015-0087-5\"}],\"title\":\"OFDM-based

        this paper, we propose a novel estimation and decoding scheme for power-line
        communication (PLC) systems in impulsive noise environments. The proposed
        scheme is based on the turbo coding combined with adaptive noise compensation
        to reduce burst errors and multipath effects. For this purpose, the PLC channel
        and noise models are introduced, then, the turbo encoder/decoder are inserted
        in the mapper/demapper and the pilot insertion block for the sake of enhancing
        preliminary estimation of the transmitted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
        signals. The proposed impulsive noise compensator is based on the estimation
        of the impulse bursts using a new blanking/clipping function, and on the estimation
        of the signal to impulse noise ratio and the peak to average power ratio.
        Simulation results illustrate that receivers with combined turbo coding and
        the proposed noise compensator drastically outperform existing receivers under
        impulsive noise. In comparison to some existing schemes, the proposed scheme
        reaches its perfect performance in a reduced 15-paths environment, when the
        bit error rate and mean square error performance are tested. The improvements
        in SNR performance are more than 16\_dB for BPSK modulation and can reach
        12\u201320\_dB for 16-QAM modulation, when a high impulsive noise level is

        AESS\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractUrban consumers in affluent cities
        are typically divorced from the landscapes and farmers that produce their
        food. Most food is made available to these consumers via global retail systems,
        operating within an overarching paradigm of industrial commodity production.
        This paradigm induces one-way flows of resources from rural hinterlands to
        cities, with farmers undercompensated for their services\u2014a process which
        is inherently unsustainable and unjust. By unwittingly eroding processes upon
        which they are utterly dependent, urban consumers are making themselves vulnerable.
        Potentially, this vulnerability could be reduced if urban food consumption
        was linked to regional production, but for many cities, the volumes of food
        required do not match regional output. Framed using a human ecological systems-based
        template, this paper presents case studies of three cities that have contrasting
        relationships with their regional food-producing landscapes. Canberra, Australia,
        could not consume all its regional production and so is in food surplus. Tokyo,
        Japan, could not meet its consumption needs from its region and so is in food
        deficit. Copenhagen, Denmark, could probably meet its needs from its region
        but chooses to reduce its food-producing land area and focus production on
        high-value meat products from pigs fed on imported low-value grains. Despite
        their differing food procurement strategies, producers and consumers in all
        three cases remain co-dependent upon each other and vulnerable to the processes
        being driven by the industrial paradigm. Consequently, a shift to a new \u2018biosensitive\u2019
        paradigm is required, within which the social and environmental aspects of
        food production and consumption would be respected. This paradigm shift would
        reduce food choice and convenience and likely increase cost, so what would
        motivate consumers to support it? The answer suggested is that consumers could
        embrace the new food system if it had features that they valued sufficiently
        to compensate for the forgone values of the old system. Features that consumers
        could positively value include personal skills in the creation of meals, knowledge
        of the provenance and production standards of ingredients, and convivial relationships
        with producers. Pragmatically, these values are most likely to arise from
        consumers interacting with local food systems. Hence, it is argued, the primary
        value of local food systems lies not in the absolute volumes of food that
        they produce but in their educative capacity to foster a shift to a biosensitive
        paradigm. This new paradigm could extend concern to all food-producing landscapes
        and farmers, wherever on the planet they were located.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12205-015-0078-9\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12205-015-0078-9\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12205-015-0078-9\"}],\"title\":\"Influence

        study investigated the influence of evapotranspiration on future drought risk

        After generating the drought indices under the Representative Concentration

        drought frequency analyses were performed and drought risks were estimated

        between nutrient deficiencies and age-related diseases and give rational recommendations
        for substitution. Both malnutrition and low levels of specific nutrients are

        in the link between bowel and joint inflammation. Otherwise, up to date, pathogenetic
        mechanisms are still largely unknown and the exact influence of the bowel
        activity on rheumatic manifestations is not clearly explained. Due to evidence-based

        the bioavailability and effects of metals in sediments is of major concern
        in context with sediment risk assessment. This study aimed to investigate
        the bioavailability and molecular effects of metals spiked into riverine sediments
        to zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos. Embryos were exposed to a natural and
        an artificial sediment spiked with cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni)
        and zinc (Zn) individually or as a mixture at concentrations ranging from
        150 to 3000\_mg/kg dry weight (dw) over 48\_h, and uptake of metals was determined.
        Furthermore, transcript abundances of the metallothioneins MT1 and MT2, the
        metal-responsive element-binding transcription factor (MTF) and the genes
        sod1 , hsp70 and hsp90\u03B11 were measured as indicators of metal-induced
        or general cellular stress. D. rerio embryos accumulated metals from sediments
        at concentrations up to 100 times greater than those spiked to the sediment
        with the greatest bioaccumulation factor (BAF) for Cu from artificial sediment
        (275.4\u2009\xB1\u200941.9 (SD)). Embryos accumulated greater concentrations
        of all metals from artificial than from natural sediment, and accumulation
        was greater when embryos were exposed to individual metals than when they
        were exposed to the mixture. Exposure of embryos to Zn or the mixture exhibited
        up to 30-fold greater transcript abundances of MT1, MT2 and hsp70 compared
        to controls which is related to significant uptake of Zn from the sediment.
        Further changes in transcript abundances could not be related to a significant
        uptake of metals from sediments. These studies reveal that metals from spiked
        sediments are bioavailable to D. rerio embryos directly exposed to sediments
        and that the induction of specific genes can be used as biomarkers for the
        exposure of early life stages of zebrafish to metal-contaminated sediments.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10593-015-1751-0\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10593-015-1751-0\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10593-015-1751-0\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10593-015-1751-0\"}],\"title\":\"Transformations

        were (i) to reveal the pattern of phylogeny of Pseudamnicola inhabiting the
        Aegean Islands, (ii) to describe and analyse the variation of the morphology
        in 17 populations of Pseudamnicola from the springs on the Aegean Islands
        not studied so far and considering also another seven populations studied
        earlier and (iii) to find out which model is more applicable to the island
        Pseudamnicola populations: either a model in which a relict fauna rich in
        endemics is differentiated in a way that mainly reflects the geological history
        of the area or a model in which a relatively young fauna is composed of more
        or less widely distributed taxa, with relatively high levels of gene flow
        among the springs they inhabit. To address the above issues, the morphology
        and the mitochondrial genes\u2014cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and ribosomal
        16S\u2014and nuclear genes\u2014ribosomal 18S, 28S and histone 3 (H3)\u2014were
        analysed. COI and COI+16S rRNA+18S datasets gave trees with identical topology
        in both ML and Bayesian inference. The 24 studied populations of Pseudamnicola
        form 16 clades, each of them generally having low levels of intrapopulation
        genetic differentiation. The generalised mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) procedure
        and the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) analysis for COI identified
        16 Pseudamnicola entities coinciding with clades of the ML tree based on 44
        haplotypes and 189 sequences. The present pattern of diversity, together with
        dating of divergence time, reflects a short story of colonisation/recolonisation,
        supported by the Late Pleistocene land bridges, rather than the consequences
        of earlier geological events. The principal component analysis (PCA) on the
        shells of the molecularly distinct clades showed differences, although variability
        ranges often overlap. Female reproductive organs showed no differences between
        the clades, and penile characters differed only in some cases.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11018-015-0751-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11018-015-0751-x\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11018-015-0751-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11018-015-0751-x\"}],\"title\":\"The

        (free-living, 0.2 to 2.0\_\u03BCm; particle-associated, 2.0 to 297\_\u03BCm)
        using 150\u2009\xD7\u2009150 paired-end Illumina sequencing. Forty eight sample

        outcomes in patients with initially non-shockable rhythms.MethodsWe tested
        for an association between subsequent shock delivery in EMS resuscitation
        and clinical outcomes in patients with initially non-shockable rhythms (n
        = 11,481) through a survey of patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
        in the Kanto region (SOS-KANTO) 2012 study cohort, Japan. The primary investigated
        outcome was 1-month survival with favorable neurological functions. The secondary
        outcome variable was the presence of subsequent shock delivery. We further
        evaluated the association of interval from initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
        to shock with clinical outcomes.ResultsIn the univariate analysis of initially
        non-shockable rhythms, patients who received subsequent shock delivery had
        significantly increased frequency of return of spontaneous circulation, 24-hour
        survival, 1-month survival, and favorable neurological outcomes compared to
        the subsequent not shocked group ( P \\u003c0.0001). In the multivariate logistic

        study was to assess the effect of land-use intensity, characteristics of linear
        habitats (field borders) and their surrounding fields (landscape) on small
        mammal richness and abundance in agricultural systems of Argentina. In autumn
        2009, we performed a removal sampling in 60 traplines located in the field
        borders of high or low land-use intensity regions. In traplines under high
        land-use intensity we found seven species while under low land-use intensity
        we found ten. Characteristic species of grasslands and woodlands such as Monodelphis

        order to promote the risk-based strategy in the investigation, assessment,

        Risk Assessment (HERA) software was developed. It is vital to validate the
        HERA model and compare the inter-model differences of HERA model against other
        available risk assessment tools. This paper discusses the similarities and

        are the mainstay of treatment for chronic asthma. However, nonadherence rates
        for long-term inhaler therapy among adults are estimated to exceed 50\_%.
        Nonadherence is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and diminished
        quality of life. Research suggests that adherence is associated with patients\u2019
        satisfaction with their treatment regimen and other factors, such as concomitant
        allergic rhinitis and tobacco use.MethodsThis prospective, cross-sectional
        survey of physicians and their patients evaluated the relationship between
        patient satisfaction with attributes of inhaler devices, treatment adherence,
        and clinical outcomes. Primary care and specialist physicians completed a
        physician-reported patient record form for patients with a confirmed asthma
        diagnosis. Patients for whom a physician-reported form was completed were
        invited to complete a patient-reported form. Both surveys collected information
        about demographics, symptoms, exacerbation history, treatment, smoking status,
        comorbidities, type of inhaler device, and treatment adherence. Patients also
        indicated the degree to which they were satisfied with attributes of their
        currently prescribed inhaler device(s). Partial least squares path modeling
        quantified relationships between latent variables and clinical outcomes.ResultsA
        total of 243 patients were included in our analysis and 41\_% had poorly controlled
        asthma. More favorable clinical outcomes were significantly associated with
        greater patient satisfaction with drug delivery ( P \u2009=\u20090.002), higher
        medication adherence ( P \u2009=\u20090.049), no history of tobacco use (
        P \u2009\\u003c\u20090.001), and absence of comorbid allergic rhinitis ( P
        \u2009=\u20090.005). Attributes associated with device satisfaction included
        patient perceptions of consistency in the amount of drug delivery to the lungs,
        ease of use, and feedback about the number of remaining doses.ConclusionsHigher
        patient satisfaction with their asthma drug delivery inhaler device is a significant
        predictor of more favorable clinical outcomes while allergic rhinitis and
        smoking history were negatively associated with optimal control of asthma.
        These findings provide clinicians with opportunities to improve patients\u2019
        clinical outcomes by tailoring choice of inhaler device therapy and providing
        education about the correct way to use the device to ensure optimal outcomes.
        Patients will likely benefit from medical therapy to manage comorbid allergic
        rhinitis and smoking cessation interventions. Patients unable to stop smoking
        may require alternative medical therapies to improve their clinical outcomes.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s40172-015-0033-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s40172-015-0033-5\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40172-015-0033-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40172-015-0033-5\"}],\"title\":\"Trade

        organic matter (SOM) content is the major soil component affecting pesticide
        sorption. However, recent studies have highlighted the fact that it is not
        the total carbon content of the organic matter, but its chemical structure
        which have a profound effect on the pesticide\u2019s sorption. In the present
        study, sorption of atrazine and metsulfuron-methyl herbicides was studied
        in four SOM fractions viz. commercial humic acid, commercial lignin, as well
        as humic acid and humin extracted from a compost. Sorption data was fitted
        to the Freundlich adsorption equation. In general, the Freundlich slope (1/
        n ) values for both the herbicides were \\u003c1. Except for atrazine sorption
        on commercial humic acid, metsulfuron-methyl was more sorbed. Desorption results
        suggested that atrazine was more desorbed than metsulfuron-methyl. Lignin,
        which showed least sorption of both the herbicides, showed minimum desorption.
        Sorption of atrazine was best positively correlated with the alkyl carbon
        (adjusted R ^2\_=\_0.748) and carbonyl carbon (adjusted R ^2\_=\_0.498) but,
        their effect was statistically nonsignificant ( P \_=\_0.05). Metsulfuron-methyl
        sorption showed best positive correlation with carbonyl carbon (adjusted R
        ^2\_=\_0.960; P \_=\_0.05) content. Sorption of both the herbicides showed
        negative correlation with O/N-alkyl carbon. Correlation of herbicide\u2019s
        sorption with alkyl and carbonyl carbon content of SOM fractions suggested
        their contribution towards herbicide sorption. But, sorption of metsulfuron-methyl,
        relatively more polar than atrazine, was mainly governed by the polar groups
        in SOM. IR spectra showed that H-bonds and charge-transfer bonds between SOM
        fraction and herbicides probably operated as mechanisms of adsorption.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13391-015-4497-z\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13391-015-4497-z\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13391-015-4497-z\"}],\"title\":\"Enhanced

        initiated) for an operator analysis of expressions like \u2018It is true,
        known, obligatory that p\u2019 as opposed to the predicative analysis in their

        war der bedeutendste Vertreter des franz\xF6sischen Humanismus des 16. Jahrhunderts.
        Fragmentarisch verstreut in seinen \u201EEssais\u201C und in chronologischer
        Folge im Tagebuch seiner B\xE4derreise nach Italien schildert er ausf\xFChrlich
        sein ihn vom 46. Lebensjahr bis zum Tode begleitendes Nierensteinleiden. Ein
        zus\xE4tzliches Gewicht erh\xE4lt dieses urologische Selbstzeugnis durch die
        au\xDFergew\xF6hnliche Pers\xF6nlichkeit des Patienten, der seine Urolithiasis
        und deren Auswirkungen auf sein eigenes Leben nicht nur aus subjektiver Sicht
        reflektiert, sondern seine Krankheitserfahrung zum Ausgangspunkt kritischer
        \xDCberlegungen zu Stellenwert und Grenzen der medizinischen M\xF6glichkeiten
        seiner Epoche macht. In klarer Erkenntnis der Schwierigkeit \xE4rztlicher
        Praxis postuliert er eine erfahrungsgest\xFCtzte rationale Herangehensweise.
        Besonders interessant ist Montaignes Haltung zu den \xC4rzten seiner Zeit.
        Er sieht den Nutzen einer Arztkonsultation f\xFCr sich und generell f\xFCr
        den Patienten nur selten als gegeben an, lastet dies \u2013 trotz z.\_T. heftiger
        anti\xE4rztlicher Invektiven \u2013 aber weniger den \xC4rzten selbst an als

        construction is a primary cause of the loss of ecosystems and their services.
        However, such loss of ecosystem services has not been reflected in key decision-making
        processes, such as in cost-benefit analysis due to difficulty in pricing the
        cost. This study proposes a framework for pricing the loss of regulating ecosystem
        services caused by road construction. Two important characteristics of the
        proposed framework are the adoption of the replacement cost method and the
        use of limited information in the planning phase of road projects. A case
        study was conducted to validate the proposed framework, with an emphasis on
        carbon sequestration, flood mitigation, and water storage services, based
        on 49 typical road construction projects in the Republic of Korea. On average,
        the costs of the loss of carbon sequestration, flood mitigation, and water
        storage services were estimated to be 5,055, 6,412, and 8,004 in units of
        $/lane-km, respectively, and the total costs were estimated to be an average
        of 19,474 $/lane-km, accounting for 0.47% of the direct construction cost.
        These findings are the effort for pricing the loss of ecosystem services caused
        by road construction from an engineering perspective. The proposed framework
        can be used to provide clear guidance for sustainable development.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s13391-015-4499-x\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13391-015-4499-x\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13391-015-4499-x\"}],\"title\":\"Effect

        On the other hand, the etched surface roughness became degraded as the hillock

        Global Science and Technology Forum\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractThe
        objective of this paper is to raise a challenge to Ilhan Inan\u2019s claim
        ( 2013 ) that an agent\u2019s curiosity ceases when the agent is firmly certain
        about the object of curiosity that is of interest to him, and to supplement
        his account by appealing to an aspect of curiosity that Inan overlooks substantively:
        open-mindedness . To achieve this objective, I first provide a brief summary
        of Inan\u2019s claim that an agent\u2019s curiosity is directly proportional
        to his interest and uncertainty , and inversely proportional to evidence and
        belief . Second, I discuss my objection to an aspect of Inan\u2019s claim
        that firm certainty and (high) interest yields no curiosity . In ordinary
        enquiries or cases of propositional curiosity (e.g., whether questions), Inan\u2019s
        claim that firm certainty extinguishes curiosity is convincing. However, there
        can be objectual curiosity cases (e.g., what questions) where Inan\u2019s
        claim may not be sufficient. Moreover, in many academic enquiries, a scientist
        may remain motivated to expend extra epistemic and cognitive capital, despite
        his firm certainty about his once imaginable aspects of the object of curiosity,
        for the sake of unimaginable possibilities. Fueled by his continued curiosity,
        it is not uncommon for a scientist to take self-initiatives and reconsider
        propositions he was once certain about. Based on his past experiences, he
        might have learned that certainty is generally impermanent and does not always
        last forever, which could keep his curiosity and hence the possibility of
        discovering more truths alive. Third, I present a number of rebuttals to my
        objection and show how they fall short of supporting Inan\u2019s account including
        the role of other feelings such as fear and anxiety about losing face, and
        knowing but being subjectively uncertain, which may motivate continued curiosity
        even when the agent is firmly certain . Fourth, I suggest an alternative view
        by adding open-mindedness to Inan\u2019s curiosity formulation that could
        help exculpate my objection. Instead of Inan\u2019s proposition, I suggest
        that one can remain curious about an objective he is interested in, despite
        being certain about it, when he is open-minded . (Baehr, 2012) Open-mindedness
        is a facilitating virtue and an activity that is a cognitive moving beyond
        or transcending of the person\u2019s doxastic commitments, thus facilitating
        curiosity. Open-mindedness assists in keeping the agent\u2019s interest and
        uncertainty alive, and helps freeing the mind beyond default beliefs and binds
        of certainty.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1186/s12909-015-0382-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s12909-015-0382-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s12909-015-0382-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12909-015-0382-6\"}],\"title\":\"Saudi

        students receive theoretical and clinical training in pediatric behavioral

        on the students\u2019 perceptions and practice of such techniques. The purpose
        of this study was to evaluate Saudi dental students\u2019 perceptions of behavior
        guidance techniques used in pediatric dentistry, and to assess the changes
        in their perceptions after 1 academic year of a didactic and clinical educational
        course.MethodsThis longitudinal study was carried out once at the beginning
        and once at the end of the 2013/2014 academic year at the College of Dentistry,
        King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire measuring the
        perceived acceptability of behavior guidance techniques was completed by 78
        fourth-year dental students before and after a pediatric dental course. Acceptability
        ratings were scored on a 5-point Likert scale and compared and evaluated in
        relation to demographic data. Paired t -test and one-way analysis of variance
        were used for the statistical analyses.ResultsBefore the course, the highest
        scores were for reinforcement and desensitizing techniques and the lowest
        were for aversive and communicative techniques. After the course, statistically
        significant increases were found in the acceptability of aversive techniques
        (voice control and hand-over-mouth), all pharmacological techniques, and modeling.
        Most communicative techniques and clinical situations were also rated as significantly
        more acceptable. Statistically significant decreases in acceptability ratings
        were found in promising a toy, and immobilization by staff or a parent. Immobilization
        using a papoose board, modeling, the presence of parents during the child\u2019s
        treatment, and most communicative techniques were rated as significantly more
        acceptable by male students than female students.ConclusionsIn general, Saudi
        dental students rated most basic behavior guidance techniques as acceptable.
        An educational course, including didactic and clinical components, improved
        their acceptability ratings, and had a considerable influence on their perceptions
        of behavior guidance in pediatric dentistry.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s00120-015-3940-y\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00120-015-3940-y\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00120-015-3940-y\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00120-015-3940-y\"}],\"title\":\"Das

        as the technology continues to evolve and as usage increases. The survey assessed
        personal perspectives, opinions on clinical implementation and clinical utilization
        of ECS. The sample included 337 GCs of varying clinical fields, of whom 150
        reported practicing in reproductive settings. Our findings demonstrate that,
        at the time, GCs indicated general agreement with ECS as a concept \u2013
        for example, most GCs agreed that carrier screening should address diseases
        outside of current guidelines and also indicated personal interest in electing
        ECS. There were also disagreements or concerns expressed regarding appropriate
        pre- and post-test counseling (e.g., the content and delivery mode of adequate
        informed consent) and practical implementation (e.g., the amount of time available
        for follow-up care). This was the first quantitative study of a large number
        of GCs and it revealed initial overall support for ECS among the GC profession.
        The authors plan to re-administer a similar survey, which may reveal changes

        with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receive treatment with anti-tumour necrosis
        factors over several years, it is important to evaluate their long-term safety
        and efficacy. The objective of this study was to examine the safety and benefits
        of certolizumab pegol (CZP)+methotrexate (MTX) treatment for almost 5 years
        in patients with RA.MethodsPatients who completed the 24-week Rheumatoid Arthritis
        Prevention of Structural Damage (RAPID) 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT;
        NCT00160602), or who were American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 non-responders
        at Week 16, entered the open-label extension (OLE; NCT00160641). After \u22656
        months treatment with CZP 400 mg every two weeks (Q2W), dose was reduced to
        200 mg Q2W, the approved maintenance dose. Safety data are presented from
        all patients who received \u22651 dose CZP (Safety population, n=612). Efficacy
        data are presented to Week 232 for the intent-to-treat (ITT, n=492) and Week
        24 CZP RCT Completer (n=342) populations, and through 192 weeks of dose-reduction
        for the Dose-reduction population (patients whose CZP dose was reduced to
        200 mg, n=369). Radiographic progression (modified total Sharp score change
        from RCT baseline \\u003e0.5) to Week 128 is reported for the Week 24 CZP
        Completers.ResultsIn the RCT, 619 patients were randomized to CZP+MTX (n=492)
        or placebo+MTX (n=127). Overall, 567 patients (91.6%) entered the OLE: 447
        CZP and 120 placebo patients. Of all randomized patients, 358 (57.8%) were
        ongoing at Week 232. Annual drop-out rates during the first four years ranged
        from 8.4\u201315.0%. Event rates per 100 patient-years were 163.0 for adverse
        events (AEs) and 15.7 for serious AEs. Nineteen patients (3.1%) had fatal
        AEs (incidence rate=0.8). Clinical improvements in the RCT were maintained
        to Week 232 in the CZP Completers: mean Disease Activity Score 28 (Erythrocyte
        Sedimentation Rate) change from baseline was \u22123.4 and ACR20/50/70 responses
        68.4%/47.1%/25.1% (non-responder imputation). Similar improvements observed
        in the ITT were maintained following dose-reduction. 73.2% of CZP Completers
        had no radiographic progression at Week 128.ConclusionsIn patients with active
        RA despite MTX therapy, CZP was well tolerated, with no new safety signals
        identified. CZP provided sustained improvements in clinical outcomes for almost
        5 years.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00160602 and NCT00160641

        due to adhesions and pressing effects of Meckel\u2019s diverticulum near the

        recent (2008- present) crisis of financial capitalism is having an enormous
        impact on the lives of working people all over the world, but it has also
        hit the largest sector of archaeological activity which has been called commercial
        archaeology, or contract or developer-funded archaeology. Despite its detrimental
        effects, the situation has provided an opening for a radical rethinking and
        reflection on the underlying assumptions of this sector, its ethical and political
        premises, its long-term viability, and more importantly, the need for alternatives.
        Within this context, this paper aims to show that the logic of capital was
        embedded in the process of the constitution of modernist archaeology, right
        from the start. It also demonstrates the highly problematic operation of commercial
        archaeology for archaeologists, material culture, and the vast majority of
        the public. It proposes that what it needs to change radically is the foundational
        logic of modernist archaeology which makes it part of the framework of capital:
        its fetishization of things, and their treatment as autonomous objects, divorced
        from the relationships, flows and connections that have led to their constitution.

        on the conception of life and semiosis as co-extensive an attempt is given
        to classify cognitive and communicative potentials of species according to
        the plasticity and articulatory sophistication they exhibit. A clear distinction
        is drawn between semiosis and perception, where perception is seen as a high-level
        activity, an integrated product of a multitude of semiotic interactions inside
        or between bodies. Previous attempts at finding progressive trends in evolution
        that might justify a scaling of species from primitive to advanced levels
        have not met with much success, but when evolution is considered in the light
        of semiosis such a scaling immediately catches the eye. The main purpose of
        this paper is to suggest a scaling of this progression in semiotic freedom
        into a series of distinct steps. The elleven steps suggested are: 1) molecular
        recognition, 2) prokaryote-eukaryote transformation (privatization of the
        genome), 3) division of labor in multicellular organisms (endosemiosis), 4)
        from irritability to phenotypic plasticity, 5) sense perception, 6) behavioral
        choice, 7) active information gathering, 8) collaboration, deception, 9) learning
        and social intelligence, 10) sentience, 11) consciousness. In light of this,
        the paper finally discusses the conceptual framework for biosemiotic evolution.
        The evolution of biosemiotic capabilities does not take the form of an ongoing
        composition of simple signs (icons, indices, signals, etc.) into composite
        wholes. Rather, it takes the shape of the increasing subdivision and control
        of a primitive, holophrastic perception-action circuit already committed to
        \u201Cproto-propositions\u201D (dicisigns) reliably guiding action already
        in the most primitive species.\"}],\"facets\":[{\"name\":\"subject\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"Characterization

        acute toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO_2) that occur concomitantly
        in the aquatic environment with other contaminants such as arsenic (As) is
        little known in crustaceans. The objective of the present study is to evaluate
        whether coexposure to nTiO_2 can influence the accumulation, metabolism, and
        oxidative stress parameters induced by arsenic exposure in the gills and hepatopancreas
        of the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei . Organisms were exposed by dissolving
        chemicals in seawater (salinity\u2009=\u200930) at nominal concentrations
        of 10\_\u03BCg/L nTiO_2 or As^III, dosed alone and in combination. Results
        showed that there was not a significant accumulation of As in either tissue
        type, but the coexposure altered the pattern of the metabolism. In the hepatopancreas,
        no changes were observed in the biochemical response, while in the gills,
        an increase in the glutamate-cysteine-ligase (GCL) activity was observed upon
        exposure to As or nTiO_2 alone, an increase in the reduced glutathione (GSH)
        levels was observed upon exposure to As alone, and an increase in the total
        antioxidant capacity was observed upon exposure to nTiO_2 or nTiO_2\u2009+\u2009As.
        However, these modulations were not sufficient enough to prevent the lipid
        damage induced by nTiO_2 exposure. Our results suggest that coexposure to

        factors. Traffic safety research in curve sections, however, so far has been
        confined to only investigating the effect of highway geometry factors on traffic

        which recognizes the geometric structure of road as different from actual.
        The research first presents data collected on the geometry of highways in

        a rating scale for curve-section safety level is presented with a consideration

        criteria for the safety level as the curve sections are developed, and thus
        can be utilized in selecting a priority order for projects when implementing

        : Mitochondrial diseases are a clinically, biochemically and genetically heterogeneous

        It might therefore be expected that this variation be reflected in the age

        \u2018end-of-life\u2019 period and causes of death in mitochondrial disease
        patients. For some specific syndromes, the associated clinical problems might
        predict the cause of death, but for many patients, it remains difficult to
        provide an accurate prognosis. Aims : To describe a retrospective cohort of
        adult mitochondrial disease patients who had attended the NHS Highly Specialised
        Services for Rare Mitochondrial Diseases in Newcastle upon Tyne (UK), evaluate
        life expectancy and causes of death and assess the consequences for daily

        on laboratory findings, biochemical investigations and genetic studies were
        analysed retrospectively. Results : A total of 30 adult mitochondrial patients

        potential barrier of SiOC such as the Schottky barrier (SB) in a short range
        and Ohmic contact in a long range. TFTs on SiOC with Poole-Frenkel contact
        as high SB operated under the threshold voltage, and then became free from
        the threshold voltage shift. However, the TFTs on high polar SiOC with Ohmic
        contact in a short range was also showed the unipolar characteristics by the
        trapping behavior as well as instability owing to the operation at high drain
        bias voltage over the threshold voltage.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5317-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5317-6\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5317-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5317-6\"}],\"title\":\"Power

        the last 15 years chemotherapy and immunotherapy of indolent and aggressive
        B-cell lymphomas have been considerably improved, e.g. with the monoclonal
        anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as idelalisib.
        Nevertheless, autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) after high-dose therapy
        remains an option for patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas. For
        selected patients with B-cell lymphomas and a very unfavorable prognosis allogeneic
        SCT from a related or unrelated donor should be considered.ObjectiveThis article
        discusses the indications for autologous SCT in patients with B-cell lymphomas
        based on the examples of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular
        lymphoma (FL) before and after the introduction of rituximab and provides
        an overview on the results of therapy. Indications for allogeneic SCT in patients
        with these entities are also discussed with reference to, among others registry
        studies.Results and discussionBefore the introduction of rituximab, autologous
        SCT following high-dose therapy was clearly superior to chemotherapy alone
        in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Despite the improvement of
        outcomes in patients with DLBCL, 10\u201340\u2009% of patients still suffer
        a relapse. Younger adults with relapsed chemosensitive DLBCL may achieve a
        long-lasting progression-free survival of approximately 50\u2009% when autologous
        SCT is performed. For patients with chemosensitive relapsed FL autologous
        SCT also remains an option. Future studies should clarify the value of allogeneic
        SCT as compared to autologous SCT for younger patients with relapsed or refractory
        B-cell lymphomas.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s10544-015-0006-2\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10544-015-0006-2\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10544-015-0006-2\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10544-015-0006-2\"}],\"title\":\"Facile

        is a powerful yet gentle technique for manipulating cells and particles that
        has quickly earned a place in the lab-on-a-chip toolkit. However, traditional
        construction techniques for acoustophoretic resonators have typically required
        prohibitively expensive and laborious processing methods. Here, we propose
        a highly cost-effective and cleanroom-free construction technique for transversal
        acoustophoretic resonators. Channels with two different widths of 750 and
        300\_\u03BCm were constructed using a simple glass and polyimide sandwiching
        technique. Half and full wavelength resonators were then established using
        1 and 5\_MHz ultrasound respectively and polystyrene beads were successfully
        manipulated in both types of resonators. This construction technique was then
        utilized to demonstrate a bifurcation and trifurcation microchannel with 600\_\u03BCm
        widths and 2.5\_MHz ultrasound. Our approach addresses some of the key drawbacks
        of acoustophoretic devices by drastically simplifying the fabrication and
        prototyping of transversal resonators and will assist in expanding this technology

        properties, enzyme activity, and microbial functional diversity coevolve with

        functional diversity in relation to soil processes. To strengthen the results,
        a parallel measurement of enzyme activities was performed with microplate-fluorometric

        Mediterranean areas under xeric moisture and mesic temperature soil regimes,

        Global Science and Technology Forum\",\"genre\":\"\",\"abstract\":\"AbstractIt
        has been commonly argued that there are traces of Jean Paul Sartre on the
        philosophical system of his partner, Simone de Beauvoir. Some claim that Beauvoir
        was not original enough when constructing her system and developing her thoughts;
        according to some others, she even was not a philosopher. From the perspective
        of Beauvoir, she didn\u2019t even consider herself as a philosopher but as
        an author. For her, to call somebody a philosopher, they should be like Spinoza,
        Hegel, or Sartre who constructs a comprehensive philosophical system, loves
        philosophy, teaches philosophy, understands philosophy, and uses philosophy
        in their works. Given these criteria, Sartre was a philosopher for her and
        she admits that Sartre\u2019s philosophy influenced her a lot. Furthermore,
        she clearly expresses that there was a mutual influence indeed, which means
        she also influenced Sartre, but her impacts on him were in terms of literature,
        not philosophy. To give an example, after writing his biography books, Sartre
        wrote The Words where the traces of Beauvoir can be seen quite easily. This
        point can also be derived from Sartre\u2019s admittance that he got the clarity
        and truth in his works--especially when describing a gesture, analyzing a
        situation, or observing an incident--by means of Beauvoir\u2019s meticulous
        style and rich experiences. Sartre also indicates that Beauvoir was a perfect
        complement and privileged reader for him. In this work, our primary focus
        will be on the details of the influence of Sartre on Beauvoir. Here, I have
        to point out that even though the title of this paper is determined as \u201CThe
        Impacts of Sartre on Beauvoir\u201D indeed the word \u201Cbenefit,\u201D instead
        of \u201Cimpact,\u201D would do better for our purpose. It is because though
        Beauvoir was influenced from Sartre\u2019s philosophical identity, when building
        her thoughts we must say she mostly \u201Cbenefited\u201D from Sartre\u2019s
        philosophy. We can easily see the examples of this point in several contexts:
        first, in the notion of ambiguity, and second, in her analysis of the position
        of woman. Also, in her notion of \u201Cthe other\u201D which is a threat for
        the independence of an individual, she shares the same ideas with Sartre in
        her early writings, but later, she changed her direction and adopted a different
        view. If we examine the notion of Beauvoir\u2019s \u201Cambiguity,\u201D though
        it has various meanings, what she means is that a person is a free and unique
        subject on the one hand; and on the other hand that person is an object for
        others. Here, Beauvoir benefits from Sartre\u2019s existential types. She
        agrees with Sartre on the idea that human existence contains both being-in-itself
        and being-for-itself; however, she thinks that having these two types of being
        together in their existence leads to an ambiguity for human beings. Sartre
        sees humans as beings that are always in a relationship with the other. And
        in this relationship, when being-for-itselfsubmit to the other, it becomes
        an object for the other\u2019s freedom. While being-for-itself perceives the
        other as subject, she, herself, becomes an object. This fact expresses an
        ambiguity for Beauvoir. Another issue we can associate with the notion of
        \u201Cambiguity\u201D is related to the relationship between self and the
        other, the relationship that relies on the confrontation of the consciousness
        of the self with the consciousness of the other. At this point, the \u201CI\u201D
        who identifies himself as an absolute being sees the other\u2019s consciousness
        as a threat and acts like an enemy towards it. It is because the subject that
        was exposed to the perspective of the other becomes an object now and she
        loses her freedom due to the intervention of the other. The other makes her
        an unguarded being. Now, the subject is not an active being but the object
        of the other. Thus, due to these restraints of the other on the subject\u2019s
        freedom, the subject must deny the hegemony of the other and get over the
        problem by making the other an object. Similar to Sartre, Beauvoir, too, sees
        the existence of the other or others as a danger for her own freedom at the
        beginning. She considers freedom in individualistic way and sees the others
        as barriers for her freedom. But later, she changes her stance, and begins
        to consider the other as a necessary condition for her own freedom. The last
        point I am going to focus on is the philosophical source of The Second Sex.
        One of her masterpieces, The Second Sex, in which she gives the explanation
        of the oppressions women face and established the principles of modern feminism,
        is about the women who represent \u201Cthe other gender\u201D due to fact
        that women are always identified in terms of the differences of their oppressors,
        men. In The Second Sex, she examines the essential features that make a woman
        a woman and at the end she comes up with the notion of \u201Cthe other.\u201D
        When reaching this notion, in order to show how she applied existentialist
        ideas of ontology and ethics, she says that men perceive themselves as \u201CI\u201D
        or \u201Cthe subject\u201D and women perceive themselves as \u201Cthe other.\u201D
        Beauvoir improves the claims of Sartre in The Second Sex in a unique way,
        and further put forwards that women are regarded as \u201Cthe other\u201D
        and men are called as \u201Cthe subject.\u201D At this point, if the other
        becomes a threat for the subject or \u201CI,\u201D then, it can be said that
        women, too, become a similar threat for men. Surely, there are other points
        that can be said about the impacts of Sartre on Beauvoir. We will also be
        examining those points as well as the above ones in this work.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.7603/s40706-015-0006-5\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.7603/s40706-015-0006-5\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7603/s40706-015-0006-5\"}],\"title\":\"The

        and their macroeconomic models; later on we will discuss the current state
        of Post-Keynesian Economics, again based on a comparative analysis. Post-Keynesian
        Economics was developed in the mid \u201880s as a reaction not only against
        New Classical School but also against New Keynesian economists because the
        assumptions and hence the conclusions of the latter were not deemed Keynesian
        enough. Keynesian Economics was mainstream both in the USA and Europe, both
        in academic circles and in the field of implementation by governments and
        Central Banks from 1936 and WW II up to the \u201870s. The debate that took
        place during this period between Neo-Keynesian economists in the USA and Neo-Classical
        economists that led to the Neo-Classical Synthesis and the reaction of Orthodox
        Keynesian Economists in the UK to Neo-Classical Synthesis will be referred
        to later. Keynesian economics here embraces both Neo-Keynesian economists
        and Orthodox Keynesian economists as mainstream against the Traditional Classical
        and the Neo-Classical System. Today, we witness that at present New Keynesian
        School is more widespread and influential compared to Post-Keynesian. One
        possible reason is that the former school sprang up in the USA while the latter
        basically in the UK; and USA today is much more influential worldwide compared
        say to the times when Keynes lived. But this should not be the sole or even
        the major reason why Post-Keynesianism is less popular. The reason which would
        likely explain the difference in popularity is that in their normative value
        judgments Post-Keynesian economists assign a heavy weight to improving income
        distribution while New Keynesian economists, on the whole, are less concerned
        with this goal.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.7603/s40706-015-0013-6\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.7603/s40706-015-0013-6\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7603/s40706-015-0013-6\"}],\"title\":\"Fair

        channels are important contributors to the initiation and the maintenance
        of chronic pain states. Blocking T-type channels is therefore a possible therapeutic
        strategy for relieving pain. Here, we report the Cav3.2 T-type channel blocking
        action of a previously reported small organic molecule, KYS-05090S. This compound
        was able to reduce transiently expressed Cav3.2 currents with low micromolar
        affinity and mediated a hyperpolarizing shift in half-inactivation potential.
        KYS-05090S was then tested in models of acute and neuropathic pain. KYS-05090S
        (10\_\u03BCg/10\_\u03BCl delivered intrathecally) significantly reduced acute
        pain induced by formalin in both the tonic and inflammatory phases. Its antinociceptive
        effect was not observed when delivered to Cav3.2 null-mice revealing a Cav3.2-dependent
        mechanism. KYS-05090S also reduced neuropathic pain in a model of partial
        sciatic nerve injury. Those results indicate that KYS-05090S mediates a potent
        analgesic effect in inflammatory and neuropathic pain through T-type channel
        modulation, suggesting that its scaffold could be explored as a new class
        of analgesic compounds.\"},{\"identifier\":\"doi:10.1007/s12098-015-1899-8\",\"url\":[{\"format\":\"html\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12098-015-1899-8\"},{\"format\":\"pdf\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"value\":\"http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12098-015-1899-8\"},{\"format\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"value\":\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12098-015-1899-8\"}],\"title\":\"Infant

        34 consecutive patients with malignant hilar biliary obstruction underwent
        percutaneous placement of a Y-shaped branched covered stent for palliative
        treatment. Technical and clinical success, complications, cumulative patient
        survival, and stent patency were evaluated.ResultsStent placement was technically
        successful in all patients. All patients showed adequate biliary drainage
        on the follow-up cholangiogram. Mean serum bilirubin level (10.9\_mg/dl) decreased
        significantly 1\_week (5.7\_mg/dl) and 1\_month (2.6\_mg/dl) after stent placement
        ( p \_\\u003c\_0.01). Complications associated with the procedure included
        hemobilia ( n \_=\_3) and biloma ( n \_=\_1). During the mean follow-up period
        of 225 (range 12\u2013820) days, nine patients (26.5\_%) developed stent occlusion
        caused by tumor overgrowth ( n \_=\_8) and sludge ( n \_=\_1). Two of them
        underwent coaxial placement of a second stent with good results. The median

        colorectal surgery. Also, in clinical practice, little attention is paid to
        the psychological impact of complications.MethodsPatients undergoing colorectal

        3\_days, 6\_weeks, and 1\_year, using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression
        (CES-D), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires.
        Patient data and complications were prospectively recorded. Postoperative
        CES-D, STAI, and SF-36 scores in patients with minor and severe complications
        were compared to scores of patients without complications using a general
        linear model.ResultsOf 218 patients, 130 (59.6\_%) had complications. Colorectal
        surgery significantly increased depressive symptoms and anxiety levels in
        the same amount in all patient subgroups. Furthermore, it also lowered all

        voles are sensitive to fragmentation, narrow stipes of permanent grass should
        be maintained or even re-established in the cultivated areas to improve life
        conditions for small rodents and other wildlife.\"}],\"facets\":[{\"name\":\"subject\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"Characterization
