        sought respondents' views on the presidency, crime in the United States, and
        race relations. Respondents were asked for their opinions on President Bill
        Clinton and his handling of the presidency and race relations, whether he
        had a clear vision for the country, whether he was honest and in possession
        of moral and ethical standards, whether he was innovative and committed to
        his beliefs, and whether he understood the needs of the American people. Those
        queried were asked what they felt were the greatest problems facing the United
        States today, specifically with respect to crime. Respondents were asked to
        assess the rate of crime in the country and in their communities, their personal
        safety, their fear of becoming a victim of violent crime, and their personal
        experiences with crime. On the topic of race relations, respondents were asked
        for their opinions on the past and future trends of the Clinton administration
        in handling race issues. They were asked to assess race relations in the United
        States, and to comment on whether they believed that Blacks were still discriminated
        against, and whether preferences in college admissions for minorities should
        still exist. A series of questions covered the role of race in network entertainment
        programs. Topics covered the impact of programs whose main characters were
        primarily of one race, the frequency of such programs, and the impact of programs
        in which the cast was a mix of people of different races. Finally, respondents
        were asked if they had close friends of another race, and whether they had
        either brought that friend to their home or been a guest at the friend's home.
        Background information on respondents includes age, race, sex, ethnicity,
        education, political party, political orientation, family income, and demographics
        of area of residence.</dc:description>\n          <dc:identifier>2492</dc:identifier>\n

        6-9, 2006, is part of a continuing series of monthly surveys that solicit
        public opinion on the presidency and on a range of other political and social
        issues. Respondents were asked to give their opinions on the current direction
        of the country, the most important problem the country is facing, the national
        economy, and to rate the job performance of the United States Congress. Respondents
        were also asked about the way George W. Bush was handling certain issues,
        such as the economy, immigration, the war in Iraq, and terrorism, whether
        or not they approved of his overall job performance, and whether or not he
        and his policies would affect the way they would vote in Congressional elections.
        The next section of the survey addressed immigration, legal and illegal immigrants,
        amnesty, and a security fence between the United States and Mexico. The survey
        also contained questions about Pope Benedict XVI, the Catholic clergy, various
        religious groups, Creationism, the Bible, and the respondent's religious background,
        beliefs, and practices. Respondents were then asked for their opinions on
        the Republican and Democratic parties, and the war in and the future of Iraq.
        Additional questions solicited information on whether or not the respondents
        or someone they knew had served in Iraq, as well as the respondents' television
        news viewing habits. Background information on respondents includes military
        service, voter registration status, party identification, marital status,
        sex, religious preference, education record, age, ethnicity, and income.</dc:description>\n

        American Time Use Survey (ATUS) collects information on how people living
        in the United States spend their time. Data collected in this study measured
        the amount of time that people spent doing various activities in 2005, such
        as paid work, child care, religious activities, volunteering, and socializing.
        Respondents were randomly selected from households that had completed their
        final month of the Current Population Survey (CPS), and were interviewed two
        to five months after their household's last CPS interview. Respondents were
        interviewed only once and reported their activities for the 24-hour period
        from 4 a.m. on the day before the interview until 4 a.m. on the day of the
        interview. Respondents indicated the total number of minutes spent on each
        activity, including where they were and whom they were with. Except for secondary
        child care, data on activities done simultaneously with primary activities
        were not collected. Part 1, Respondent and Activity Summary File, contains
        demographic information about respondents and a summary of the total amount
        of time they spent doing each activity that day. Part 2, Roster File, contains
        information about household members and nonhousehold children under the age
        of 18. Part 3, Activity File, includes additional information on activities
        in which respondents participated, including the location of each activity
        and the total time spent on secondary child care. Part 4, Who File, includes
        data on who was present during each activity. Part 5, ATUS-CPS 2005 File,
        contains data on respondents and members of their household collected two
        to five months prior to the ATUS interviews during their participation in
        the Current Population Survey (CPS). Parts 6-10 contain supplemental data
        files that can be used for further analysis of the data. Part 6, Case History
        File, contains information about the interview process, such as identifiers
        and interview outcome codes. Part 7, Call History File, gives information
        about each call attempt, including the call date and outcome. Part 8, Trips
        File, provides information about the number, duration, and purpose of overnight
        trips away from home for two or more nights in a row. Part 9, Replicate Weights
        File I, contains base weights, replicated base weights, and replicate final
        weights for each case that was selected to be interviewed for ATUS, while
        Part 10, Replicate Weights File II, contains replicate weights that were generated
        using the 2006 weighting method. Demographic variables include sex, age, race,
        ethnicity, education level, income, employment status, occupation, citizenship
        status, country of origin, relationship to household members, and the ages
        and number of children in the household.</dc:description>\n          <dc:identifier>4709</dc:identifier>\n

        that caused the death, place of death, residence of the deceased (e.g., region,
        division, state, county), whether an autopsy was performed, and the month
        and day of the week of the death. In addition, data are supplied on the sex,
        race, age, marital status, education, usual occupation, and origin or descent
        of the deceased. Along with to the combined Territory Public-Use file, a subset
        based on state of occurrence has been created for American Samoa, Guam, Northern
        Marianas, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The multiple cause of death
        fields were coded from the MANUAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION
        OF DISEASES AND RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS, TENTH REVISION (ICD-10).</dc:description>\n
