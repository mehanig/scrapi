        regional limb perfusion (IVRLP) with tiludronate is a commonly used treatment
        for distal limb orthopedic disease in horses, but doses and protocols are
        anecdotal. IVRLP exposes articular cartilage within the perfused area to tiludronate,
        raising concerns about safety of this treatment, as high tiludronate concentrations
        (\u226519mg/L) were harmful for cartilage in vitro. This is the first study
        to evaluate synovial fluid tiludronate concentrations following IVRLP to determine
        safety for articular cartilage in horses. Synovial fluid cytology variables
        and tiludronate concentrations were evaluated in the navicular bursa, coffin
        and fetlock joints following IVRLP of one front limb with low dose (0.5mg,
        n=6) or high dose (50mg, n=6) tiludronate. The contralateral limb was perfused
        with saline as a control. Synovial fluid samples were taken 1 week prior and
        30 minutes following IVRLP from all structures and 24 hours post-perfusion
        from coffin and fetlock joints. Synovial fluid tiludronate concentrations
        were lower in&#13;\nlimbs perfused with 0.5mg in all synovial structures (metacarpophalangeal
        joint = 3.7 \xB1 1.5 mg/L, distal interphalangeal joint = 16.3 \xB1 1.9 mg/L,
        navicular bursa = 6.0 \xB1 1.9 mg/L) than in limbs perfused with 50 mg (metacarpophalangeal
        joint = 0.04 \xB1 0.02 mg/L, distal interphalangeal joint = 0.12 \xB1 0.06
        mg/L, navicular bursa = 0.08 \xB1 0.03 mg/L) at tourniquet release. Only limbs
        perfused with 50mg had tiludronate detectable in synovial fluid 24 hours post-perfusion.
        There were no significant differences in synovial fluid cytology variables
        between samples from limbs perfused with saline vs. tiludronate. Thus, perfusion
        with tiludronate at doses used did not cause synovial inflammation in comparison
        to saline control limbs. Cytology variables did increase over time in both
        treated and control limbs, suggesting that IVRLP and/or synovial fluid sample
        acquisition stimulates an inflammatory response within synovial structures.
        Doses of 0.5mg or 50mg of tiludronate given via IVRLP resulted in synovial
        fluid concentrations that can be considered safe for articular cartilage based
        on previous in-vitro data. Tiludronate concentrations in bone should be explored
        to determine safety for bone and possible treatment efficacy for orthopaedic
        diseases of the distal equine limb.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2014-06-20T20:40:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-12-20T09:00:08Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-06-10</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-06-10</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis/Dissertation</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1957/49273</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n</oai_dc:dc>\n</metadata>\n

        OH radicals were investigated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure
        in an indoor Teflon chamber and novel mono NO\u2082-DaiP, and mono NO\u2082-DalP
        products were identified. Quartz fiber filters (QFF) were used as a reaction
        surface and the filter extracts were analyzed by GC/MS for nitrated-PAHs (NPAHs)
        and tested in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay, using Salmonella typhimurium
        strain TA98 (with and without metabolic activation). In parallel to the laboratory
        experiments, a theoretical study was conducted to rationalize the formation
        of NPAH isomers based on the thermodynamic stability of OH-PAH intermediates,
        formed from OH-radical-initiated reactions. NO\u2082 and NO\u2083/N\u2082O\u2085
        were effective oxidizing agents in transforming PAHs to NPAHs, with BaP-d\u2081\u2082
        being the most readily nitrated. Reaction of BaP-d\u2081\u2082, BkF-d\u2081\u2082
        and BghiP-d\u2081\u2082 with NO\u2082 and NO\u2083/N\u2082O\u2085 resulted
        in the formation of more than one mono-nitro isomer product, while the reaction
        of DaiP-d\u2081\u2084 and DalP resulted in the formation of only one mono-nitro
        isomer product. The direct-acting mutagenicity increased the most after NO\u2083/N\u2082O\u2085
        exposure, particularly for BkF-d\u2081\u2082 in which di-NO\u2082-BkF-d\u2081\u2080
        isomers were measured. The deuterium isotope effect study suggested that substitution
        of&#13;\ndeuterium for hydrogen lowered both the direct and indirect acting
        mutagenicity of NPAHs and may result in an underestimation of the mutagenicity
        of the novel NPAHs identified in this study.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2014-07-16T00:27:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-12-19T09:00:08Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-01-07</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>Jariyasopit,

        from temperate latitudes transition between growth and dormancy to survive
        dehydration and freezing stress during winter months. We employed activation
        tagging to isolate a dominant mutation affecting release from dormancy, and
        identified the corresponding gene EARLY BUD-BREAK 1 (EBB1). We demonstrate
        through positioning of the tag, expression analysis, and retransformation
        experiments that EBB1 encodes a putative AP2/ERF transcription factor. Transgenic
        upregulation of the gene caused early bud-flush, while down-regulation delayed
        bud-break. Native EBB1 expression was highest in actively-growing apices,
        undetectable during the dormancy period, but rapidly increased prior to bud-break.
        The EBB1 transcript was localized in the L1/L2 layers of the shoot meristem
        and leaf primordia. EBB1-overexpressing transgenic plants displayed enlarged
        shoot meristems, open and poorly differentiated buds, and a higher rate of
        cell division in the apex. Transcriptome analyses of the EBB1 transgenics
        identified 971 differentially-expressed genes whose expression correlated
        with the EBB1 expression changes in the transgenic plants. Promoter analysis
        among the differentially expressed genes for presence of a canonical EBB1
        binding site identified 65 putative target genes indicative of a broad regulatory
        context of EBB1 function. Our results suggest that EBB1 has a major and integrative
        role in reactivation of meristem activity after winter dormancy.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2014-10-16T23:34:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-12-20T09:00:07Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-07-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>Yordanov,

        date: 2015</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Professional development is a
        critical part of education, especially in career and technical education (CTE).
        CTE programs have rapidly changing technological foundations, and while the
        CTE teachers' primary focus is to prepare students for entry-level positions
        in their occupational areas, CTE teachers are also required to embed academics
        into their curriculum as well. The purpose of this census study was to determine
        the perceived professional development needs of secondary Oregon industrial
        and engineering (I &amp; E) teachers (N=193) during the 2013-2014 school year;
        112 responded for a return rate of 58%.&#13;\nThis study revealed that Oregon's
        I &amp; E workforce is older than in other content areas in the state, with
        over half of the respondents over 50 years old and nearing retirement. This
        study revealed a difference in priorities of the perceived CTE professional
        development needs between federal and state leaders with those who work in
        the field. Grant writing and funding opportunities, motivating students to
        learn, and developing curriculum-based school-to-work and school-to-career
        activities were the top three professional development needs identified by
        respondents. This study also found that the sustainability of programs was
        a major concern for professional development by the respondents.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2014-12-18T23:48:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-12-18T23:48:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-12-03</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-12-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis/Dissertation</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/1957/54747</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n</oai_dc:dc>\n</metadata>\n
